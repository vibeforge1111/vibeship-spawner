# Skill Generator Improvement Tips

> Learnings from benchmark testing that improve all future skills

This document captures patterns discovered through skill benchmarking. When creating or improving skills, apply these learnings.

---

## What Works (Keep Doing)

*Add learnings here after running benchmarks*

| Pattern | Evidence | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| *Example: Battle scar stories in identity* | *+12 expertise score* | *High* |

---

## What Doesn't Work (Stop Doing)

*Add anti-patterns discovered through benchmarks*

| Anti-Pattern | Evidence | Alternative |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| *Example: Generic advice without examples* | *Low gotcha_awareness scores* | *Always include code/process examples* |

---

## Identity Improvements

### Findings

*Document identity-related benchmark learnings*

- **Finding:** [What you discovered]
- **Evidence:** [Score difference, jury feedback]
- **Action:** [How to apply to skill creation]

### Best Practices

1. Include specific "battle scar" stories (failures the expert learned from)
2. State 3-5 opinionated principles, not generic advice
3. Use first-person voice with experience markers ("I've seen...", "After years of...")

---

## Sharp Edge Improvements

### Findings

*Document sharp-edge-related benchmark learnings*

- **Finding:** [What you discovered]
- **Evidence:** [Score difference, jury feedback]
- **Action:** [How to apply to skill creation]

### Best Practices

1. Every edge needs a concrete "situation" - when does this happen?
2. "Why" section must have real consequences (not theoretical)
3. Solution section needs copy-paste ready examples
4. Detection patterns where possible (even for non-code: marketing copy, docs)
5. Symptoms should be observable, not abstract

---

## Pattern Quality

### Findings

*Document pattern-related benchmark learnings*

- **Finding:** [What you discovered]
- **Evidence:** [Score difference, jury feedback]
- **Action:** [How to apply to skill creation]

### Best Practices

1. Patterns must be copy-paste ready
2. Show before/after transformation
3. Include "when to use" context
4. Name patterns memorably

---

## Example Quality

### Findings

*Document example-related benchmark learnings*

- **Finding:** [What you discovered]
- **Evidence:** [Score difference, jury feedback]
- **Action:** [How to apply to skill creation]

### Best Practices

1. All code examples must be runnable (no syntax errors)
2. Include all necessary imports/setup
3. Show wrong way AND right way
4. Keep examples focused on one concept

---

## Non-Technical Skills

### Findings

*Document learnings specific to marketing/strategy/product skills*

- **Finding:** [What you discovered]
- **Evidence:** [Score difference, jury feedback]
- **Action:** [How to apply to skill creation]

### Best Practices

1. Use frameworks and checklists instead of code examples
2. Include real-world "before/after" transformations
3. Symptoms should reference business metrics
4. Detection patterns can target copy/docs (regex still works)

---

## Benchmark Score Correlations

*Track what correlates with high benchmark scores*

| Factor | Correlation | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| *Example: Detection pattern exists* | *+8 gotcha_awareness* | *Even null patterns help* |

---

## Skill Creation Checklist Updates

Based on benchmark findings, update the creation checklist:

- [ ] *Add new checklist items based on findings*
- [ ] *Remove items that don't correlate with quality*

---

## Changelog

| Date | Finding | Applied To |
|------|---------|------------|
| *YYYY-MM-DD* | *Initial template created* | *All skills* |

*This document is updated after each benchmark run. Use generate-report.py to update automatically.*
