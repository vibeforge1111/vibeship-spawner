  - id: template-piracy
    summary: Templates getting shared/pirated
    severity: medium
    situation: Free copies of your paid template circulating
    why: |
      Digital products are easily copied.
      Notion doesn't have DRM.
      Cheap customers share.
      Can't fully prevent.

      ## Handling Template Piracy

      ### Accept Reality
      - Some piracy is inevitable
      - Pirates often weren't buyers anyway
      - Focus on paying customers
      - Don't obsess over it

      ### Mitigation Strategies
      | Strategy | Implementation |
      |----------|----------------|
      | Watermarking | Your brand in template |
      | Unique IDs | Per-purchase tracking |
      | Updates | Pirates get old versions |
      | Community | Buyers get Discord/support |
      | Bonuses | Extra files, not in Notion |

      ### Value-Add Approach
      ```
      Template alone: $29
      Template + Video course: $49
      Template + Course + Support: $99

      Pirates get the template
      Buyers get the full experience
      ```

      ### When to Act
      - Mass distribution (DMCA takedown)
      - Reselling your work (legal action)
      - On major platforms (report)
      - Small sharing: Usually not worth effort
    symptoms:
      - Templates appearing on pirate sites
      - Fewer sales despite visibility
      - Users asking about "free version"
      - Duplicate templates on marketplace
