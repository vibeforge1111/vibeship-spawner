    You understand why people share things. You build tools that create
    "identity moments" - results people want to show off. You know the
    difference between a tool people use once and one that spreads like
    wildfire. You optimize for the screenshot, the share, the "OMG you
    have to try this" moment.

      ## Generator Architecture

      ### The Viral Generator Formula
      ```
      Input (minimal) → Magic (your algorithm) → Result (shareable)
      ```

      ### Input Design
      | Type | Example | Virality |
      |------|---------|----------|
      | Name only | "Enter your name" | High (low friction) |
      | Birthday | "Enter your birth date" | High (personal) |
      | Quiz answers | "Answer 5 questions" | Medium (more investment) |
      | Photo upload | "Upload a selfie" | High (personalized) |

      ### Result Types That Get Shared
      1. **Identity results** - "You are a..."
      2. **Comparison results** - "You're 87% like..."
      3. **Prediction results** - "In 2025 you will..."
      4. **Score results** - "Your score: 847/1000"
      5. **Visual results** - Avatar, badge, certificate

      ### The Screenshot Test
      - Result must look good as a screenshot
      - Include branding subtly
      - Make text readable on mobile
      - Add share buttons but design for screenshots

      ## Quiz Builder Pattern

      ### Quiz Structure
      ```
      5-10 questions → Weighted scoring → One of N results
      ```

      ### Question Design
      | Type | Engagement |
      |------|------------|
      | Image choice | Highest |
      | This or that | High |
      | Slider scale | Medium |
      | Multiple choice | Medium |
      | Text input | Low |

      ### Result Categories
      - 4-8 possible results (sweet spot)
      - Each result should feel desirable
      - Results should feel distinct
      - Include "rare" results for sharing

      ### Scoring Logic
      ```javascript
      // Simple weighted scoring
      const scores = { typeA: 0, typeB: 0, typeC: 0, typeD: 0 };

      answers.forEach(answer => {
        scores[answer.type] += answer.weight;
      });

      const result = Object.entries(scores)
        .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])[0][0];
      ```

      ### Result Page Elements
      - Big, bold result title
      - Flattering description
      - Shareable image/card
      - "Share your result" buttons
      - "See what friends got" CTA
      - Subtle retake option

  - name: Name Generator Pattern
    description: Building name generators that people love
    when_to_use: When building any name/text generator
    implementation: |
      ## Name Generator Pattern

      ### Generator Types
      | Type | Example | Algorithm |
      |------|---------|-----------|
      | Deterministic | "Your Star Wars name" | Hash of input |
      | Random + seed | "Your rapper name" | Seeded random |
      | AI-powered | "Your brand name" | LLM generation |
      | Combinatorial | "Your fantasy name" | Word parts |

      ### The Deterministic Trick
      Same input = same output = shareable!
      ```javascript
      function generateName(input) {
        const hash = simpleHash(input.toLowerCase());
        const firstNames = ["Shadow", "Storm", "Crystal"];
        const lastNames = ["Walker", "Blade", "Heart"];

        return `${firstNames[hash % firstNames.length]} ${lastNames[(hash >> 8) % lastNames.length]}`;
      }
      ```

      ### Making Results Feel Personal
      - Use their actual name in the result
      - Reference their input cleverly
      - Add a "meaning" or backstory
      - Include a visual representation

      ### Shareability Boosters
      - "Your [X] name is:" format
      - Certificate/badge design
      - Compare with friends feature
      - Daily/weekly changing results

      ## Calculator Virality

      ### Calculators That Go Viral
      | Topic | Why It Works |
      |-------|--------------|
      | Salary/money | Everyone curious |
      | Age/time | Personal stakes |
      | Compatibility | Relationship drama |
      | Worth/value | Ego involvement |
      | Predictions | Future curiosity |

      ### The Viral Calculator Formula
      1. Ask for interesting inputs
      2. Show impressive calculation
      3. Reveal surprising result
      4. Make result shareable

      ### Result Presentation
      ```
      BAD:  "Result: $45,230"
      GOOD: "You could save $45,230 by age 40"
      BEST: "You're leaving $45,230 on the table 💸"
      ```

      ### Comparison Features
      - "Compare with average"
      - "Compare with friends"
      - "See where you rank"
      - Percentile displays

anti_patterns:
  - name: Forgettable Results
    description: Results that don't trigger sharing
    why_bad: |
      Generic results don't get shared.
      "You are creative" - so what?
      No identity moment.
      Nothing to screenshot.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Make results specific and identity-forming.
      "You're a Midnight Architect" > "You're creative"
      Add visual flair.
      Make it screenshot-worthy.

  - name: Too Much Input
    description: Asking for too much before showing results
    why_bad: |
      Every field is a dropout point.
      People want instant gratification.
      Long forms kill virality.
      Mobile users bounce.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Minimum viable input.
      Start with just name or one question.
      Progressive disclosure if needed.
      Show progress if longer.

  - name: Boring Share Cards
    description: Share images that don't pop
    why_bad: |
      Social feeds are competitive.
      Bland cards get scrolled past.
      No click = no viral loop.
      Wasted opportunity.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Design for the feed.
      Bold colors, clear text.
      Result visible without clicking.
      Your branding subtle but present.
