# Interactive Portfolio Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: over-engineered-portfolio
    summary: Portfolio more complex than your actual work
    severity: medium
    situation: Spent 6 months on portfolio, have 2 projects to show
    why: |
      Procrastination disguised as work.
      Portfolio IS a project, but not THE project.
      Diminishing returns on polish.
      Ship it and iterate.

      ## Right-Sizing Your Portfolio

      ### The MVP Portfolio
      | Element | MVP Version |
      |---------|-------------|
      | Hero | Name + title + one line |
      | Projects | 3-4 best pieces |
      | About | 2-3 paragraphs |
      | Contact | Email + LinkedIn |

      ### Time Budget
      ```
      Week 1: Design and structure
      Week 2: Build core pages
      Week 3: Add 3-4 projects
      Week 4: Polish and launch
      ```

      ### The Truth
      - Your portfolio is not your best project
      - Shipping beats perfecting
      - You can always iterate
      - Better projects > better portfolio

      ### When to Stop
      - Core pages work on mobile
      - 3-4 solid projects showcased
      - Contact form works
      - Loads in < 3 seconds
      - Ship it.
    symptoms:
      - Been "working on portfolio" for months
      - More excited about portfolio than projects
      - Portfolio tech more impressive than work
      - Afraid to launch

  - id: mobile-broken
    summary: Portfolio looks great on desktop, broken on mobile
    severity: high
    situation: Recruiters check on phone, everything breaks
    why: |
      Built desktop-first.
      Didn't test on real devices.
      Complex interactions don't translate.
      Forgot about thumb zones.
    solution: |
      ## Mobile-First Portfolio

      ### Mobile Reality
      - 60%+ traffic is mobile
      - Recruiters browse on phones
      - First impression = mobile impression

      ### Mobile Must-Haves
      - Readable without zooming
      - Tappable links (min 44px)
      - Navigation works
      - Projects load fast
      - Contact easy to find

      ### Testing Checklist
      ```
      [ ] iPhone Safari
      [ ] Android Chrome
      [ ] Tablet sizes
      [ ] Slow 3G simulation
      [ ] Real device (not just DevTools)
      ```

      ### Graceful Degradation
      ```css
      /* Complex hover → simple tap */
      @media (hover: none) {
        .hover-effect {
          /* Show content directly */
        }
      }
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Looks great in browser DevTools
      - Broken on actual phone
      - Text too small
      - Buttons hard to tap
      - Navigation hidden
    detection_pattern: "mobile|phone|responsive|small screen"

  - id: no-call-to-action
    summary: Visitors don't know what to do next
    severity: medium
    situation: Great portfolio, zero contacts
    why: |
      No clear CTA.
      Contact buried at bottom.
      Multiple competing actions.
      Assuming visitors will figure it out.
    solution: |
      ## Portfolio CTAs

      ### Primary CTAs
      | Goal | CTA |
      |------|-----|
      | Get hired | "Let's work together" |
      | Freelance | "Start a project" |
      | Network | "Say hello" |
      | Specific role | "Hire me for [X]" |

      ### CTA Placement
      ```
      Hero section: Main CTA
      After projects: Secondary CTA
      Footer: Final CTA
      Floating: Optional persistent CTA
      ```

      ### Making Contact Easy
      - Email link (mailto:)
      - LinkedIn (opens new tab)
      - Calendar link (Calendly)
      - Simple contact form
      - Copy email button

      ### What to Avoid
      - Contact form only (people hate forms)
      - Hidden contact info
      - Too many options
      - Vague CTAs ("Learn more")
    symptoms:
      - Lots of views, no contacts
      - People don't know you're available
      - Contact page is afterthought
      - No clear ask
    detection_pattern: "no contacts|not hiring|how to reach|where.*email"

  - id: outdated-projects
    summary: Portfolio shows old or irrelevant work
    severity: medium
    situation: Best work is 3 years old, newer work not shown
    why: |
      Haven't updated in years.
      Newer work is "not ready."
      Scared to remove old favorites.
      Portfolio drift.
    solution: |
      ## Portfolio Freshness

      ### Update Cadence
      | Action | Frequency |
      |--------|-----------|
      | Add new project | When completed |
      | Remove old project | Yearly review |
      | Update copy | Every 6 months |
      | Tech refresh | Every 1-2 years |

      ### Project Pruning
      Keep if:
      - Still proud of it
      - Relevant to target jobs
      - Shows important skills
      - Has good results/story

      Remove if:
      - Embarrassed by code/design
      - Tech is obsolete
      - Not relevant to goals
      - Better work exists

      ### Showing Growth
      - Latest work first
      - Date projects (or don't)
      - Show evolution if relevant
      - Archive instead of delete
    symptoms:
      - jQuery projects in 2024
      - "I did this in college"
      - Tech stack doesn't match target jobs
      - Haven't touched portfolio in 2+ years
    detection_pattern: "old|outdated|years ago|update|refresh"
