# Micro-SaaS Launcher Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: no-distribution
    summary: Great product, no way to reach customers
    severity: high
    situation: Built product, can't get users
    why: |
      Built first, marketing second.
      No existing audience.
      No SEO, no ads, no community.
      "If you build it, they will come" is false.
    solution: |
      ## Distribution First

      ### Before Building, Answer:
      - Where do my customers hang out?
      - Can I reach them for free?
      - Do I have an existing audience?
      - Is SEO viable for this?

      ### Distribution Channels
      | Channel | Time to Results | Cost |
      |---------|-----------------|------|
      | SEO | 6-12 months | Low |
      | Content marketing | 3-6 months | Low |
      | Paid ads | Immediate | High |
      | Community | 1-3 months | Low |
      | Product Hunt | One day | Free |
      | Partnerships | 1-2 months | Free |

      ### Build Distribution Into Product
      ```
      - "Powered by [Your Product]" badge
      - Invite/referral features
      - Public profiles/pages (SEO)
      - Shareable results/reports
      - Integration marketplace listings
      ```

      ### If Stuck
      1. Start content marketing NOW
      2. Be active in communities (give value)
      3. Partner with complementary products
      4. Consider paid acquisition
    symptoms:
      - Zero organic traffic
      - Relying only on launches
      - No email list
      - No content strategy
    detection_pattern: "no users|can't grow|no traffic|distribution"

    summary: Building for market that can't/won't pay
    severity: high
    situation: Lots of interest, no conversions
    why: |
      Targeting consumers vs business.

      ## Fixing Churn

      ### Understand Why
      ```
      1. Email churned users (personal, not automated)
      2. Look at last active date
      3. Check onboarding completion
      4. Survey at cancellation
      ```

      | < 3% monthly | Excellent |
      | 3-5% monthly | Good |
      | 5-7% monthly | Needs work |
      | > 7% monthly | Critical |

      ### Quick Fixes
      - Improve onboarding (first 7 days critical)
      - Add "aha moment" trigger emails
      - Check if right users signing up
      - Add missing must-have features
      - Increase prices (filters serious users)

      ### Onboarding Checklist
      ```
      [ ] Clear first action after signup
      [ ] Value delivered in first session
      [ ] Email sequence for first 7 days
      [ ] Check-in at day 3 if inactive
      [ ] Success metric defined and tracked
      ```
