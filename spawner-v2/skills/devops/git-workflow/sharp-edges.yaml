  - id: force-push-disaster
    summary: Force pushing rewrites history others depend on
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You rebase your branch and force push, but a teammate has already
      pulled your branch and built on top of it. Their commits are now
      orphaned, and they'll get confusing conflicts.
    why: |
      Force push rewrites the remote history. Anyone who based work on
      the old history now has divergent timelines. This is the #1 cause
      of "git is hard" complaints. We've seen teams lose days of work.
    solution: |
      # SAFE FORCE PUSHING

      # Never force push shared branches (main, develop, release/*)

      # For your own feature branches, use --force-with-lease
      git push --force-with-lease

      # This fails if remote has commits you don't have locally
      # Prevents accidentally overwriting a teammate's push

      # If you need to update a branch others use:
      1. Communicate first
      2. Have them push their work
      3. Use --force-with-lease
      4. Have them git fetch && git reset --hard origin/branch

      # Alternative: Don't rebase shared branches, only merge
    symptoms:
      - Teammate gets "divergent branches" message
      - Commits seem to disappear
      - "Your branch and origin have diverged"
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+push\s+(-f|--force)\s+(?!.*--force-with-lease)'

  - id: reset-hard-data-loss
    summary: git reset --hard discards uncommitted work forever
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You want to discard some changes, run git reset --hard, and realize
      you had important uncommitted work. Unlike committed work, this
      cannot be recovered with reflog.
    why: |
      reset --hard modifies three things: HEAD, staging, and working
      directory. Uncommitted work in the working directory is not
      tracked by git and cannot be recovered. Even reflog can't help.
    solution: |
      # SAFER ALTERNATIVES

      # Check what you'll lose first
      git status
      git diff

      # Stash instead of reset for temporary discard
      git stash

      # Reset staged files only (keeps working directory)
      git reset HEAD

      # Reset a specific file
      git checkout -- filename

      # Discard all changes but make backup first
      git stash
      git reset --hard HEAD
      # If you need the changes back: git stash pop

      # If you did reset --hard by accident:
      # Uncommitted work is GONE
      # Committed work: check git reflog
    symptoms:
      - Hours of work just vanished
      - "I had changes in that file..."
      - No entry in git reflog for uncommitted work
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+reset\s+--hard(?!\s+HEAD\s*$)'

  - id: detached-head-commits
    summary: Commits made in detached HEAD state are easily lost
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You checkout a specific commit or tag, make changes and commit,
      then checkout a branch. Your commits are now orphaned and will
      be garbage collected.
    why: |
      Detached HEAD means you're not on any branch. Commits go to
      an anonymous branch. When you switch to a real branch, there's
      no reference to those commits. Git will garbage collect them.
    solution: |
      # DETACHED HEAD

      # You'll see this warning:
      "You are in 'detached HEAD' state..."

      # If you want to keep commits made in detached HEAD:
      git checkout -b my-new-branch

      # If you already left and want to recover:
      git reflog
      # Find your commit
      git checkout -b recovered-work abc1234

      # Prevention: always work on a branch
      # If you need to explore an old commit:
      git checkout -b explore-old abc1234

      # Check if you're in detached HEAD:
      git branch
      # If you see: * (HEAD detached at abc1234)
      # Create a branch before committing!
    symptoms:
      - Warning about detached HEAD
      - Commits disappear after checkout
      - "HEAD detached at" in git branch output
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+checkout\s+[a-f0-9]{7,40}(?!\s+-b)'

  - id: merge-vs-rebase-confusion
    summary: Using rebase on already-pushed commits causes divergence
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You push commits to a shared branch, then rebase locally, creating
      new commit hashes. Now local and remote have diverged with the
      "same" changes having different hashes.
    why: |
      Rebase creates new commits with new hashes. If the original commits
      are already on the remote, you now have two sets of "same" commits.
      Force pushing causes the force-push-disaster problem.
    solution: |
      # REBASE RULES

      # Golden rule: Don't rebase commits that exist on the remote

      # Safe: Rebase local work before pushing
      git fetch origin
      git rebase origin/main
      git push

      # Safe: Rebase before first push of feature branch
      git checkout feature
      git rebase main
      git push -u origin feature

      # UNSAFE: Rebase after pushing
      git push origin feature
      # ... later ...
      git rebase main  # Creates new commits!
      git push --force  # Rewrites remote history!

      # If branch is already pushed, use merge instead
      git checkout feature
      git merge main
      git push
    symptoms:
      - "Your branch and origin have diverged"
      - Duplicate commits in history
      - Teammates complain about conflicts
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+rebase\s+\w+(?=.*git\s+push\s+--force)'

  - id: cherry-pick-conflicts
    summary: Cherry-picking creates duplicate commits and merge conflicts
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You cherry-pick commits from one branch to another, then later merge
      the branches. Git sees the same changes with different hashes and
      may create conflicts or duplicate the changes.
    why: |
      Cherry-pick copies the change with a new hash. When branches merge,
      git doesn't know these commits are related. You might get conflicts
      on "already applied" changes or actual duplicate code.
    solution: |
      # CHERRY-PICK BEST PRACTICES

      # Cherry-pick is best for:
      - Hotfixes: pick fix to release branch
      - Backports: pick feature to older version
      - Recovery: grab specific commit from lost branch

      # Avoid when possible:
      - Features between active branches (merge instead)
      - Multiple commits (rebase instead)

      # If you must cherry-pick:
      git cherry-pick abc1234

      # Cherry-pick range (last commit excluded)
      git cherry-pick main~3..main

      # When merging later, expect to resolve as "already applied"
      # Mark as resolved even if no actual conflict

      # Alternative: Use merge with strategy
      git merge -X theirs feature  # Accept incoming for conflicts
    symptoms:
      - Merge conflicts on code that "should already be there"
      - Duplicate code after merge
      - Same logical change with two different commit hashes
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+cherry-pick'

  - id: gitignore-after-tracking
    summary: Adding to .gitignore doesn't untrack already-tracked files
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You add a file pattern to .gitignore, but the files are still being
      tracked and showing up in diffs. You committed them before adding
      to .gitignore.
    why: |
      .gitignore only affects untracked files. Once a file is tracked
      (committed), git continues tracking it. You see config files with
      secrets, node_modules, or IDE files in your repo.
    solution: |
      # REMOVE TRACKED FILES

      # Remove from git but keep on disk
      git rm --cached filename
      git rm --cached -r directory/

      # For multiple files matching pattern
      git rm --cached '*.log'

      # Then add to .gitignore and commit
      echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
      git add .gitignore
      git commit -m "chore: stop tracking log files"

      # For sensitive files already in history, see git-filter-repo
      # WARNING: This rewrites history!

      # Prevention: Add .gitignore FIRST before adding files
    symptoms:
      - .gitignore pattern doesn't seem to work
      - Secrets keep appearing in diffs
      - IDE files pollute the repo
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: submodule-confusion
    summary: Submodules create confusing state and require extra commands
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You clone a repo with submodules and they're empty. Or you update
      a submodule and teammates don't see the changes. Or you're in a
      submodule and think you're in the main repo.
    why: |
      Submodules are repos within repos. They have their own git state,
      own branches, own commits. Main repo only tracks a commit hash,
      not the submodule's branch. Many commands don't recurse by default.
    solution: |
      # SUBMODULE BASICS

      # Clone with submodules
      git clone --recurse-submodules repo-url

      # Initialize after regular clone
      git submodule update --init --recursive

      # Update submodules to latest
      git submodule update --remote

      # Pull with submodule update
      git pull --recurse-submodules

      # After updating submodule, commit the change
      cd submodule/
      git checkout new-version
      cd ..
      git add submodule/
      git commit -m "chore: update submodule to v2.0"

      # Consider alternatives:
      - Package managers (npm, pip)
      - Monorepo tools (nx, turborepo)
      - git subtree (simpler than submodules)
    symptoms:
      - Empty directories after clone
      - Submodule "stuck" on old commit
      - Confusing detached HEAD in submodule
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+submodule'

  - id: merge-conflict-panic
    summary: Panicking during merge conflicts makes things worse
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You hit a merge conflict, panic, try various commands, and end up
      in a worse state. Maybe you reset in the middle of a merge, or
      added conflict markers to the commit.
    why: |
      Merge conflicts are normal. Panicking leads to git reset, abandoned
      merges, or committed conflict markers. Take a breath - git tells
      you exactly what to do.
    solution: |
      # MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION

      # When you see conflicts:
      git status  # Shows which files have conflicts

      # In each file, you'll see:
      <<<<<<< HEAD
      your changes
      =======
      their changes
      >>>>>>> branch-name

      # Edit the file to resolve:
      1. Remove the markers (<<<<, ====, >>>>)
      2. Keep the code you want
      3. Save the file

      # Mark as resolved
      git add filename

      # Complete the merge
      git commit  # Message is pre-filled

      # If you want to abort and start over:
      git merge --abort

      # If things are really bad:
      git reset --hard HEAD  # Only if you haven't committed!

      # Tools help:
      git mergetool  # Opens configured merge tool
    symptoms:
      - Conflict markers in committed code
      - "Aborting merge due to unresolved conflicts"
      - Files stuck in unmerged state
    detection_pattern: '<<<<<<< HEAD|=======|>>>>>>> \w+'

  - id: amend-pushed-commit
    summary: Amending a pushed commit requires force push
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You commit with a typo in the message or forgot a file, amend the
      commit, then can't push because remote has the original commit.
    why: |
      Amend creates a new commit with a new hash. If you've pushed the
      original, git sees your amended commit as different. You need
      force push, which has the force-push-disaster risks.
    solution: |
      # SAFE AMENDING

      # Amend is safe for: commits you haven't pushed yet
      git commit --amend  # Edit message
      git commit --amend --no-edit  # Add staged files, keep message

      # If already pushed to your own branch:
      git push --force-with-lease

      # If already pushed to shared branch:
      # Don't amend! Make a new commit instead:
      git commit -m "fix: correct typo from previous commit"

      # Alternative: Use fixup for later squashing
      git commit --fixup abc1234
      # Later, before PR merge:
      git rebase -i --autosquash main
    symptoms:
      - "Updates were rejected because the tip of your branch is behind"
      - Need to force push after amend
      - Teammate has old version of commit
    detection_pattern: 'git\s+commit\s+--amend.*\n.*git\s+push(?!\s+--force)'
