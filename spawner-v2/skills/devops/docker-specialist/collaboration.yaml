delegation:
  - trigger: "kubernetes deployment"
    delegate_to: infra-architect
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Container specs, resource requirements"
    receive: "K8s manifests, Helm charts"

  - trigger: "CI/CD pipeline"
    delegate_to: devops
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Build requirements, registry setup"
    receive: "Pipeline configuration"

  - trigger: "security scanning"
    delegate_to: security-analyst
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Images to scan, compliance requirements"
    receive: "Vulnerability report, remediation"

  - trigger: "performance tuning"
    delegate_to: performance-hunter
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Resource usage, bottlenecks"
    receive: "Optimization recommendations"

  - trigger: "application requirements"
    delegate_to: backend
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Runtime needs"
    receive: "Dependencies, environment config"

collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I optimize Dockerfile, then devops updates pipeline"
    - "I build image, then security-analyst scans"
    - "I configure compose, then backend tests locally"

  parallel:
    - "I build images while infra-architect creates K8s manifests"
    - "I optimize layers while ci-cd-specialist configures cache"
    - "I write Dockerfile while backend documents dependencies"

  review:
    - "Review security-analyst's vulnerability findings"
    - "Review infra-architect's K8s resource limits"
    - "Review devops's registry configuration"

cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: operating-systems
    insight: "Containers share kernel - security boundary is different from VMs"
    applies_when: "Designing security model"

  - domain: networking
    insight: "Container networking adds overlay complexity"
    applies_when: "Debugging connectivity issues"

  - domain: process-management
    insight: "PID 1 has special responsibilities (reaping zombies)"
    applies_when: "Configuring entrypoint"

  - domain: caching
    insight: "Layer caching is content-addressable - order matters"
    applies_when: "Optimizing build performance"

ecosystem:
  primary_tools:
    - "Docker - Container runtime"
