  - id: running-as-root
    summary: Container running as root allows host compromise
    severity: critical
    situation: Production containers
    why: |
      Container escape vulnerability + root = root on host. CVEs like
      CVE-2019-5736 (runc) allowed exactly this. Even without escape,
      root can modify mounted volumes, access secrets, compromise
      the entire deployment.
    solution: |
      1. Create and use non-root user:
         FROM node:20-alpine
         RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
             adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

         USER nextjs
         CMD ["node", "server.js"]

      2. Use --user flag at runtime:
         docker run --user 1001:1001 myimage

      3. In Kubernetes, set securityContext:
         securityContext:
           runAsNonRoot: true
           runAsUser: 1001

      4. For images that require root (e.g., nginx):
         - Use unprivileged variants (nginx-unprivileged)
         - Or start as root, drop privileges in entrypoint

      5. Scan images for root usage:
         docker inspect --format='{{.Config.User}}' image
    symptoms:
      - Security audit failures
      - Container escape possible
      - Production policy violations
    detection_pattern: 'USER root|ENTRYPOINT.*root|runAsUser.*0'

  - id: secrets-in-image
    summary: Secrets baked into Docker image are visible
    severity: critical
    situation: Needing credentials during build
    why: |
      ARG API_KEY=secret
      RUN curl -H "Auth: $API_KEY" https://...

      The secret is now in image layers. Anyone with image access (registry,
      developer, logs) can extract it. docker history shows all ARGs.
      This has caused countless credential leaks.
    solution: |
      1. Use build secrets (BuildKit):
         # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
         RUN --mount=type=secret,id=api_key \
             API_KEY=$(cat /run/secrets/api_key) && \
             curl -H "Auth: $API_KEY" https://...

         # Build with:
         docker build --secret id=api_key,src=./api_key.txt .

      2. Use runtime environment variables:
         docker run -e API_KEY=secret myimage

      3. Use mounted secret files:
         docker run -v ./secrets:/run/secrets:ro myimage

      4. In Kubernetes, use Secrets:
         volumes:
           - name: secrets
             secret:
               secretName: api-secrets

      5. Never commit secrets to Dockerfile or .env
    symptoms:
      - Credentials in container logs
      - Secrets visible in registry
      - Security audit failure
    detection_pattern: 'ARG.*KEY|ARG.*SECRET|ARG.*PASSWORD|ENV.*=.*secret'

  - id: latest-tag
    summary: Using :latest tag breaks reproducibility
    severity: high
    situation: Image references in production
    why: |
      FROM node:latest
      Today: Node 20. Tomorrow: Node 22 (breaking changes).
      Your CI passes, production breaks. Different machines pull
      different versions. Debugging becomes impossible.
    solution: |
      1. Always use specific tags:
         FROM node:20.10.0-alpine3.19

      2. For even more reproducibility, use digest:
         FROM node@sha256:abc123...

      3. Pin in compose/K8s too:
         image: myapp:1.2.3
         # Not: image: myapp:latest

      4. Use semantic versioning in your images:
         docker build -t myapp:1.2.3 -t myapp:1.2 -t myapp:1 .

      5. Exception: Development/local where latest is convenient
    symptoms:
      - Works locally, fails in CI
      - Inconsistent behavior across environments
      - Unable to reproduce issues
    detection_pattern: ':latest|FROM.*:(?!.*\.)'

  - id: no-healthcheck
    summary: No health check means dead containers appear healthy
    severity: high
    situation: Production containers
    why: |
      Your app crashes but process stays alive. Or it's deadlocked.
      Container status: running. Reality: not serving requests.
      Load balancer keeps sending traffic. Users see errors.
    solution: |
      1. Add HEALTHCHECK in Dockerfile:
         HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
             CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

      2. Health endpoint should check dependencies:
         app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
           try {
             await db.query('SELECT 1');
             await redis.ping();
             res.json({ status: 'healthy' });
           } catch (err) {
             res.status(503).json({ status: 'unhealthy' });
           }
         });

      3. In Kubernetes, use probes:
         livenessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /health
             port: 3000
           initialDelaySeconds: 10
           periodSeconds: 30

      4. Distinguish liveness vs readiness:
         - Liveness: Is the process alive? (restart if not)
         - Readiness: Can it serve traffic? (remove from LB if not)
    symptoms:
      - Traffic sent to dead containers
      - Cascading failures
      - Long MTTR for incidents
    detection_pattern: 'HEALTHCHECK(?!.*CMD)|docker run(?!.*health)'

  - id: no-signal-handling
    summary: Container doesn't handle SIGTERM gracefully
    severity: medium
    situation: Container shutdown and restarts
    why: |
      Kubernetes sends SIGTERM, waits grace period, then SIGKILL.
      If your app ignores SIGTERM, connections drop mid-request,
      data corrupts, transactions abort. Every deployment causes errors.
    solution: |
      1. Handle shutdown in application:
         process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
           console.log('SIGTERM received, shutting down gracefully');
           await server.close();
           await db.end();
           process.exit(0);
         });

      2. Use dumb-init or tini as init:
         RUN apk add --no-cache tini
         ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--"]
         CMD ["node", "server.js"]

      3. Set appropriate grace period:
         terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30

      4. For long-running tasks, checkpoint progress

      5. Test shutdown: docker stop (SIGTERM) vs docker kill (SIGKILL)
    symptoms:
      - Errors during deployments
      - In-flight requests fail
      - Data consistency issues
    detection_pattern: 'CMD \[(?!.*tini|.*dumb-init)|ENTRYPOINT(?!.*init)'

  - id: layer-cache-busting
    summary: Inefficient Dockerfile busts cache on every build
    severity: medium
    situation: Slow Docker builds
    why: |
      COPY . .
      RUN npm install

      Every code change copies everything, busting cache, reinstalling
      all dependencies. 5 minute builds become the norm. Developers
      skip Docker, "works on my machine" returns.
    solution: |
      1. Order by change frequency (least → most):
         # System packages (rarely change)
         RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...

         # Dependencies (change occasionally)
         COPY package*.json ./
         RUN npm ci

         # Source code (changes frequently)
         COPY . .
         RUN npm run build

      2. Use .dockerignore aggressively:
         .git
         node_modules
         dist
         *.log
         .env*
         Dockerfile*
         README.md

      3. Use BuildKit cache mounts:
         RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci

      4. Separate build and runtime stages:
         FROM node:20 AS builder
         # ... build steps
         FROM node:20-alpine AS production
         COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
    symptoms:
      - Slow builds (minutes for small changes)
      - High CI costs
      - Developers avoid Docker
    detection_pattern: 'COPY \. \./RUN npm|COPY.*RUN.*install'

  - id: massive-image-size
    summary: Multi-gigabyte images slow deployments
    severity: medium
    situation: Production image deployment
    why: |
      Development image: 2GB (includes build tools, source, everything).
      Pull time: minutes. Registry storage: expensive. Startup: slow.
      Rollback: even slower. Attack surface: massive.
    solution: |
      1. Use alpine base images:
         FROM node:20-alpine  # ~100MB vs ~1GB for node:20

      2. Multi-stage builds:
         FROM node:20 AS builder
         RUN npm run build

         FROM node:20-alpine AS production
         COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
         COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules

      3. Only install production dependencies:
         RUN npm ci --only=production

      4. Remove unnecessary files:
         RUN rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* /tmp/*

      5. Use distroless for compiled languages:
         FROM gcr.io/distroless/base

      6. Check image size regularly:
         docker images | sort -k7 -h
    symptoms:
      - Slow deployments
      - High registry costs
      - Long pod startup time
    detection_pattern: 'FROM.*(?<!alpine|slim|distroless)$|npm install(?!.*production)'

  - id: pid-1-zombie
    summary: Zombie processes accumulate in container
    severity: medium
    situation: Long-running containers spawning child processes
    why: |
      Docker runs your process as PID 1. Normal init reaps zombies.
      Your app doesn't. Each child process that terminates becomes
      a zombie. Eventually you hit process limits, container fails.
    solution: |
      1. Use tini or dumb-init:
         FROM node:20-alpine
         RUN apk add --no-cache tini

         ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--"]
         CMD ["node", "server.js"]

      2. Docker's built-in init (simpler):
         docker run --init myimage

      3. In compose:
         services:
           app:
             init: true

      4. In Kubernetes:
         securityContext:
           # No direct support, use init in image

      5. Or handle signals yourself (harder):
         // node.js - not recommended for complex cases
         process.on('SIGCHLD', ...);
    symptoms:
      - `ps aux` shows many zombie processes
      - Container eventually fails
      - Resource exhaustion
    detection_pattern: 'ENTRYPOINT(?!.*tini|.*dumb-init)|CMD(?!.*init)'
