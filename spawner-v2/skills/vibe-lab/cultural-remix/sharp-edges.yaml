      Healthy ratio:

      ORIGINAL CONTENT: 60%

      | Core messaging | Brand fundamentals |

      ### Building Identity

      ```
      Ask:

      - What would we post if no trends existed?
      - What's our unique POV?
      - What do we want to be known for?
      - What would people miss if we stopped?
      ```

      ### Trend Participation Filter

      | Before Trend | Check |
      |--------------|-------|
      | Does this align with our voice? | |
      | Are we adding or just copying? | |
      | Would this work without the trend? | |

      - No distinctive voice
      - "They post every trend"
      - Nothing memorable

      ## Cultural Sensitivity

      ### The Distinction

      ```
      APPRECIATION:
      - Understanding context
      - Respecting origins
      - Giving credit
      - Adding value

      APPROPRIATION:
      - Ignoring context
      - Taking without credit
      - Reducing to aesthetic
      - Profit without acknowledgment
      ```

      ### Before Participating

      | Question | Honest Answer |
      |----------|---------------|
      | Is this our culture? | |
      | Do we understand origins? | |
      | Are we crediting source? | |
      | Would the community appreciate this? | |
      | Are we profiting from their culture? | |

      ### Safe Participation

      | Safer | Risky |
      |-------|-------|
      | Mainstream trends | Subculture specific |
      | Invited participation | Self-insertion |
      | Credited remix | Uncredited copying |
      | Collaborative | Extractive |

      ### When Uncertain

      ```
      If you're not sure:

      1. Ask someone from that community
      2. Research origins
      3. Err on side of caution
      4. Skip if uncertain

      Better to miss a trend than cause harm.

    symptoms:
      - "This isn't yours"
      - Community backlash
