  - id: too-honest
    summary: Honesty that kills sales
    severity: high
    situation: Transparency goes too far

      Scared customers away.

      ## Calibrating Honesty

      ### The Balance

      ```
      GOAL:
      Honest + Compelling

      NOT:
      - Honest but depressing
      - Honest but no value proposition
      - Honest but forgettable
      ```

      ### Order Matters

      | Order | Effect |
      |-------|--------|
      | Negative first | Turns people away |
      | Positive first, honest second | Builds trust |
      | Honest throughout | Best |

      ### Structure Template

      ```
      1. What we do well (value)
      2. Who it's perfect for (qualifying)
      3. Who it's not for (honest filter)
      4. Why we built it this way (reasoning)

      Lead with value, be honest throughout.
      ```

      ### Honesty Calibration

      | Too Honest | Just Right |
      |------------|------------|
      | "We're not that good" | "We're specialized in X" |
      | "There are better options" | "If you need Y, try Z" |
      | "We have problems" | "We prioritized A over B" |
    symptoms:
      - Conversion drops
      - Leads feel discouraged
      - "Why would I buy this?"
    detection_pattern: "too negative|discouraging|scaring away"

  - id: authenticity-theater
    summary: Fake honesty that backfires
    severity: high
    situation: Manufactured authenticity detected
    why: |
      Tried to seem honest.
      Scripted vulnerability.
      Internet detected it.
    solution: |
      ## Real vs Fake Honesty

      ### Detection Signals

      | Fake Honesty | Real Honesty |
      |--------------|--------------|
      | Follows formula | Feels genuine |
      | PR-approved | Uncomfortable |
      | Weakness is minor | Weakness is real |
      | Calculated | Spontaneous |

      ### The Authentic Test

      ```
      Ask:

      - Would we share this if it wasn't marketing?
      - Does this actually hurt to admit?
      - Is this vulnerability or performance?
      - Would a friend call BS on this?
      ```

      ### Building Real Authenticity

      | Don't | Do |
      |-------|-----|
      | Script vulnerability | Let real people speak |
      | Admit fake weaknesses | Admit real trade-offs |
      | Perform honesty | Be honest |
      | Follow formula | Say what's true |

      ### Recovery

      ```
      If authenticity seems fake:

      1. Stop performing
      2. Actually be honest
      3. Let imperfect content through
      4. Give individuals voice
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "This seems scripted"
      - Backlash against "authenticity"
      - Community calls it out
    detection_pattern: "performative|fake|scripted"

  - id: competitor-trash-talk
    summary: Anti-marketing becomes competitor bashing
    severity: medium
    situation: Honesty crosses into negativity about others
    why: |
      Comparison became attack.
      Felt like competition required it.
      Lost the honest frame.
    solution: |
      ## Honest Competition

      ### The Line

      | Honest Comparison | Bashing |
      |-------------------|---------|
      | "They're better at X" | "They suck at X" |
      | "If you need Y, try them" | "Don't use them" |
      | "We focused on A" | "They can't do A right" |
      | Factual | Emotional |

      ### Clean Comparison Format

      ```
      "For [use case], [competitor] is great.
       We built specifically for [different use case].
       If that's you, we're worth a look."

      - Acknowledges competitor strength
      - Explains differentiation
      - No negativity
      ```

      ### What to Avoid

      | Avoid | Why |
      |-------|-----|
      | Named attacks | Legal/reputation risk |
      | FUD | Erodes trust |
      | Feature comparisons | Often inaccurate |
      | Emotional language | Seems insecure |

      ### If Tempted to Bash

      ```
      Ask:

      - Why do I feel the need?
      - Am I insecure about this?
      - Would facts be enough?
      - Does this help the customer?
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "That's harsh"
      - Competitor or their fans respond
      - Looks petty
    detection_pattern: "competitor|attack|bashing"

  - id: no-value-proposition
    summary: So focused on honesty that value is lost
    severity: high
    situation: Customers don't know why to buy
    why: |
      Over-indexed on limitations.
      Forgot to sell.
      Confused honesty with anti-selling.
    solution: |
      ## Honesty WITH Value

      ### Balance Check

      ```
      Every piece of content:

      VALUE STATEMENT: ✓
      - What we do
      - Who it helps
      - Why it works

      HONEST FILTER:
      - Who it's not for
      - What to expect
      - Trade-offs made

      Both required. Value first.
      ```

      ### Content Review

      | Element | Present? |
      |---------|----------|
      | Clear benefit | |
      | Target customer | |
      | Reason to believe | |
      | Honest context | |
      | Call to action | |

      ### Formula

      ```
      "We help [specific person]
       achieve [specific outcome]
       through [mechanism].

       This works best if you [qualifier].
       If you're looking for [alternative], we're not the right fit.

       For the right customer, [specific value]."

      Value + Honesty = Trust
      ```

      ### Ratio

      | Content Type | Value : Honesty |
      |--------------|-----------------|
      | Landing page | 70 : 30 |
      | FAQ | 50 : 50 |
      | Sales call | 60 : 40 |
      | Pricing page | 50 : 50 |
    symptoms:
      - "What do you actually do?"
      - Low conversion
      - Confusion
    detection_pattern: "don't understand|what's the point|why would I"
