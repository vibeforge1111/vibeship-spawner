      ## Roast Craft

      ### 1. The Golden Rules

      ```
      PUNCH UP, NEVER DOWN
      - Target people/things with more power
      - Never mock the vulnerable
      - Punch at yourself first

      LOVE BEHIND THE BURN
      - Roasts are affection
      - You mock what you care about
      - No actual malice

      TRUTH AT THE CORE
      - Funny because it's true
      - Exaggerated truth
      - Recognizable reality
      ```

      ### 2. Roast Anatomy

      | Element | Purpose |
      |---------|---------|
      | Setup | Establish context |
      | Misdirect | Subvert expectation |
      | Punchline | The burn |
      | Tag | Extra twist (optional) |

      ### 3. Roast Types

      | Type | Target | Tone |
      |------|--------|------|
      | Self-roast | You | Confident self-awareness |
      | Affectionate | Friends/fans | Loving mockery |
      | Competitive | Rivals | Playful jabs |
      | Industry | Your field | Insider critique |
      | Universal | Human nature | Relatable observation |

      ### 4. The Line

      ```
      OK to roast:
      - Choices and actions
      - Public positions
      - Things within control
      - Yourself first

      NOT OK to roast:
      - Unchangeable traits
      - Personal tragedy

      ## Self-Roasting

      ### 1. Why Self-Deprecation Works

      ```
      Self-roasting signals:

      - Confidence (not threatened)
      - Self-awareness (growth mindset)
      - Humanity (relatable flaws)
      - Permission (others can engage)
      ```

      ### 2. Safe Self-Roast Targets

      | Target | Example |
      |--------|---------|
      | Skills | "I'm famously bad at X" |
      | Habits | "My coffee addiction is..." |
      | Past mistakes | "That time I completely..." |
      | Known quirks | "As someone who always..." |
      | Industry position | "As a [role], I naturally..." |

      ### 3. Self-Roast Formula

      ```
      1. Acknowledge flaw
      2. Exaggerate absurdly
      3. Own it completely
      4. Turn into strength (optional)

      Example:
      "I have the attention span of a goldfish"
      → "with ADHD"
      → "on espresso"
      → "and honestly that's why I ship fast"
      ```

      ### 4. Limits

      | OK | Not OK |
      |----|--------|
      | Minor flaws | Real struggles |
      | Quirks | Mental health |
      | Skills | Trauma |
      | Choices | Seeking validation |

      ## Brand Roast Strategy

      ### 1. Permission Levels

      | Level | What's Allowed |
      |-------|----------------|
      | Full (Wendy's) | Roast competitors, customers, self |
      | Medium | Self-roast, industry jokes |
      | Low | Occasional self-awareness |
      | None | Don't roast |

      ### 2. Safe Targets for Brands

      ```
      ALWAYS SAFE:
      - Self-roasting
      - Industry tropes
      - Universal experiences

      SOMETIMES SAFE (with permission):
      - Friendly competitor banter
      - Customer jokes (if consented)
      - Current events (carefully)

      RARELY SAFE:
      - Named competitors
      - Specific customers
      - Anything controversial
      ```

      ### 3. Competitive Roasting

      | Approach | Risk | Reward |
      |----------|------|--------|
      | Subtle shade | Low | Medium |
      | Direct comparison | Medium | Medium |
      | Public roast | High | High |
      | Response to being roasted | Low | High |

      ### 4. Response Roasting

      ```
      When roasted, respond with:

      1. SELF-AWARE AGREEMENT
         "Fair point, we deserved that"

      2. ESCALATED SELF-ROAST
         "That's actually generous"

      3. CLEVER COUNTER
         "Coming from you..."

      Never:
      - Get defensive
      - Explain the joke
      - Go mean
      ```

      ## Comeback Strategy

      ### 1. Comeback Types

      | Type | When | Example |
      |------|------|---------|
      | Agreement | Valid criticism | "You're not wrong" |
      | Deflection | Unfair criticism | "Anyway, about..." |
      | Escalation | Fun context | "That's generous" |
      | Counter | Earned response | Flip it on them |
      | Ignore | Toxic context | [No response] |

      ### 2. Response Timing

      ```
      Speed matters:

      IMMEDIATE (seconds)
      - Live context
      - Social media
      - Best if quick

      DELAYED (hours)
      - Need good response
      - Stakes are high
      - Better if polished

      NEVER
      - It's toxic
      - No good response
      - Not worth it
      ```

      ### 3. The Counter-Roast

      ```
      Structure:
      1. Acknowledge their point
      2. Agree or flip
      3. Add your twist
      4. End stronger

      Example:
      Them: "Your product is so simple"
      You: "Thanks, we spent months making it that way"
      ```

      ### 4. When to Not Respond

      | Situation | Response |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Genuine criticism | Thank, don't roast |
      | Toxic attack | Ignore |
      | Personal attack | Don't engage |
      | Bad faith | Walk away |
