      ## When Roasts Hurt

      ### Recognition

      | Signal | Meaning |
      |--------|---------|
      | Silence | May have hurt |
      | Defensive response | Definitely hurt |
      | Private message | Hurt + preserving face |
      | Public call-out | Seriously hurt |

      ### Immediate Response

      ```
      If you hurt someone:

      1. STOP immediately
      2. Acknowledge privately
      3. Genuine apology
      4. No "it was just a joke"
      5. Learn for next time
      ```

      ### Prevention

      | Before Roasting | Check |
      |-----------------|-------|
      | Relationship strength | Do we have history? |
      | Power dynamic | Am I punching down? |
      | Context | Is this the right moment? |
      | Private life | Hitting something real? |

      ### The Test

      ```
      Before roasting:

      "Would this person laugh at this
       in private with me?"

      If no or unsure → don't do it.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Awkward silence
      - "That was harsh"
      - Relationship damage
    detection_pattern: "hurt|too far|apologize"

  - id: insecurity-showing
    summary: Roast reveals more about roaster than target
    severity: medium
    situation: Roast comes across as jealous or bitter
    why: |
      Insecurity drove the roast.
      Needed to put someone down.
      Competitive, not playful.
    solution: |
      ## Confident vs Insecure Roasting

      ### The Difference

      | Confident Roast | Insecure Roast |
      |-----------------|----------------|
      | Playful energy | Bitter energy |
      | Elevates both | Tries to lower them |
      | Self-aware | Defensive |
      | Doesn't need to win | Needs to win |

      ### Energy Check

      ```
      Before roasting, ask:

      - Am I threatened by this person?
      - Do I want them to look bad?
      - Am I proving something?
      - Would I say this to their face?

      If yes to any → don't roast.
      ```

      ### Clean Sources

      | Source | OK? |
      |--------|-----|
      | Affection | Yes |
      | Shared experience | Yes |
      | Playful competition | Yes |
      | Jealousy | No |
      | Resentment | No |
      | Need to win | No |

      ### The Mirror

      ```
      Great roasters:
      - Are hardest on themselves
      - Don't need external validation
      - Elevate with humor
      - Build, don't tear down
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Someone's jealous"
      - Roast feels mean
      - Audience sides with target
    detection_pattern: "jealous|bitter|insecure"

    summary: Playful roasting escalates to real conflict
    severity: medium
    situation: Brand roast becomes genuine fight
    why: |
      Other side took it seriously.
      Escalation got out of control.
      Crossed from play to real.
    solution: |
      ## Competitive Roasting Limits

      ### Escalation Ladder

      ```
      Level 1: Playful jab
              ↓ OK
      Level 2: Stronger response
              ↓ Careful
      Level 3: Real criticism
              ↓ STOP
      Level 4: Genuine conflict
              ↓ Damage control
      ```

      ### De-escalation

      | Situation | Response |
      |-----------|----------|
      | They escalate | Don't match, ease off |
      | Tone shifts | Acknowledge, pivot |
      | Gets real | Exit gracefully |
      | Public conflict | Private resolution |

      ### Rules of Engagement

      ```
      Competitive roasting rules:

      1. Both sides know it's play
      2. Neither actually gets hurt
      3. Audience enjoys it
      4. Stops when not fun
      5. Relationship preserved
      ```

      ### Exit Strategies

      | Exit | How |
      |------|-----|
      | Graceful loss | "You got me there" |
      | Mutual ceasefire | "Truce?" |
      | Topic change | New post about something else |
      | Private message | Resolve out of public |
    symptoms:
      - Responses getting serious
      - Audience uncomfortable
      - Real animosity showing
    detection_pattern: "getting serious|too far|actual fight"

  - id: punching-down-mistake
    summary: Roasted someone with less power
    severity: high
    situation: Target was more vulnerable than realized
    why: |
      Didn't know full context.
      Seemed like equal.
      Power dynamic unclear.
    solution: |
      ## Power Dynamic Awareness

      ### Power Check

      | You vs Target | Direction |
      |---------------|-----------|
      | You bigger | Punching down - DON'T |
      | You equal | Proceed carefully |
      | You smaller | Punching up - OK |
      | You vs yourself | Always safe |

      ### Hidden Vulnerabilities

      ```
      Watch for:

      - Private struggles not visible
      - Context you don't know
      - Industry power dynamics
      - Platform size differences
      - Life circumstances
      ```

      ### When Uncertain

      | Certainty | Action |
      |-----------|--------|
      | Sure it's up | Roast away |
      | Might be down | Don't roast |
      | Obviously down | Never roast |

      ### Recovery

      ```
      If you punched down:

      1. Stop immediately
      2. Delete if possible
      3. Apologize genuinely
      4. Don't make it about you
      5. Learn the dynamic
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Audience turns on you
      - "Pick on someone your size"
      - Target genuinely hurt
    detection_pattern: "punching down|pick on|bully"
