# Viral Hooks Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: hook-content-mismatch
    summary: Great hook, disappointing content
    severity: high
    situation: Hook promises more than content delivers
    why: |
      Hook optimized separately.
      Content didn't match promise.
      Metrics looked good initially.
    solution: |
      ## Hook-Content Alignment

      ### The Promise-Delivery Problem

      ```
      Symptoms:
      - High click, high bounce
      - "Clickbait" comments
      - Trust erosion
      - Declining engagement over time
      ```

      ### Alignment Process

      | Step | Action |
      |------|--------|
      | 1 | Write content first |
      | 2 | Identify actual value |
      | 3 | Hook based on real value |
      | 4 | Check hook matches conclusion |

      ### The 80% Rule

      ```
      Hook should promise what 80% of readers
      would agree the content delivered.

      Test:
      "Does the content actually deliver this?"
      Ask 5 people, need 4 yes.
      ```

      ### Fixing Mismatched Hooks

      | Problem | Solution |
      |---------|----------|
      | Overpromised | Dial back hook |
      | Content weak | Strengthen content |
      | Different topic | Rewrite hook |
      | Buried value | Restructure content |
    symptoms:
      - High initial engagement
      - Comments calling out clickbait
      - Declining trust metrics
    detection_pattern: "clickbait|didn't deliver|waste of time"

  - id: audience-fatigue
    summary: Same hooks stop working on your audience
    severity: medium
    situation: Proven hooks declining in performance
    why: |
      Audience learns patterns.

      Novelty wears off.
    solution: |
      ## Combating Hook Fatigue

      ### Recognition Pattern

      ```
      Hook lifecycle:

      Novel → Effective → Recognized → Ignored → Cringe

      Your audience moves through this
      faster than new audiences.
      ```

      ### Rotation Strategy

      | Hook Type | Use Frequency |
      |-----------|---------------|
      | Story | 30% |
      | Contrarian | 20% |
      | Curiosity | 20% |
      | Direct value | 20% |
      | Pattern break | 10% |

      ### Evolution Tactics

      ```
      Keep hooks fresh:

      1. Vary structure regularly
      2. Test new formats monthly
      3. Watch what's working elsewhere
      4. Let data guide rotation
      5. Retire overused formulas
      ```

      ### Detecting Fatigue

      | Signal | Meaning |
      |--------|---------|
      | CTR dropping | Hook tired |
      | Same engagement, less reach | Platform tired of hook |
      | Comments mentioning formula | Audience sees through it |
    symptoms:
      - Declining CTR on proven hooks
      - "Here we go again" comments
      - Formula feels stale
    detection_pattern: "always the same|predictable|seen this before"

  - id: platform-mismatch
    summary: Hook optimized for wrong platform
    severity: medium
    situation: What works on one platform fails on another
    why: |
      Copied successful hook.
      Didn't adapt to platform.
      Different context.
    solution: |
      ## Platform Adaptation

      ### Platform Differences

      | Platform | Hook Character |
      |----------|----------------|
      | Twitter | Punchy, clever, text-first |
      | LinkedIn | Professional, story-based |
      | TikTok | Visual, fast, in-your-face |
      | YouTube | Thumbnail + title synergy |
      | Email | Personal, curiosity-based |

      ### Adaptation Process

      ```
      For each platform:

      1. Study native content
      2. Note hook patterns that work
      3. Adapt your hook to match
      4. Test against platform benchmarks
      5. Iterate based on data
      ```

      ### Platform-Specific Rules

      | Platform | Critical Factor |
      |----------|-----------------|
      | Twitter | First 7 words visible in preview |
      | LinkedIn | First 2 lines before "see more" |
      | TikTok | First 0.5 seconds |
      | YouTube | Thumbnail > title |
      | Email | Subject line only |

      ### Cross-Platform Hook

      ```
      Same content, different hooks:

      Twitter: "Thread on how I..."
      LinkedIn: "I failed at X. Here's what I learned:"
      TikTok: [Visual hook] + "Stop scrolling if..."
      YouTube: "Why [topic] will [outcome]"
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Works on one platform, dies on another
      - Feels off-brand for platform
      - Low engagement despite good content
    detection_pattern: "doesn't work here|wrong platform|format issue"

  - id: sensitivity-blindness
    summary: Hook that offends or alienates
    severity: high
    situation: Hook creates backlash despite good intentions
    why: |
      Optimized for clicks.
      Didn't consider implications.
      Different audiences see differently.
    solution: |
      ## Sensitivity Awareness

      ### Pre-Flight Check

      ```
      Before publishing hook:

      □ Could this be misread?
      □ Does it mock anyone?
      □ Current events make this bad?
      □ Could marginalized groups be hurt?
      □ Does it cross ethical lines?
      ```

      ### High-Risk Hook Types

      | Type | Risk | Example |
      |------|------|---------|
      | Tragedy-based | High | Using current crisis |
      | Group comparison | Medium | "Unlike [group]..." |
      | Negative framing | Medium | "Why [people] fail" |
      | Bold claims | Low-Medium | "The only way to..." |

      ### Review Process

      | Audience | Ask Them |
      |----------|----------|
      | Diverse colleague | "Does this feel off?" |
      | Target audience member | "Would you be uncomfortable?" |
      | Someone outside bubble | "What do you notice?" |

      ### Recovery

      ```
      If hook backfires:

      1. Acknowledge quickly
      2. Don't defend
      3. Apologize genuinely
      4. Learn and document
      5. Review process to prevent
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Unexpected negative reactions
      - Backlash despite intentions
      - "Read the room" comments
    detection_pattern: "offensive|insensitive|tone deaf"
