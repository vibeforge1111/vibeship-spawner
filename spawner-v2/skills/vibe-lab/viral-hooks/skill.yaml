      ## Platform Hook Optimization

      ### 1. Twitter/X Hooks

      ```
      Character limit shapes hooks:

      - Front-load value
      - Every word counts
      - Visual breaks matter

      Patterns that work:
      - "Thread:" signals value
      - "Unpopular opinion:"
      - Numbers and lists
      - Bold first statement
      ```

      ### 2. LinkedIn Hooks

      | Pattern | Example |
      |---------|---------|
      | Counter-narrative | "I disagree with [common belief]" |
      | Humble brag | "I failed spectacularly at..." |
      | Story hook | "3 years ago, I..." |
      | Value promise | "I analyzed 1000 posts. Here's what works:" |

      ### 3. YouTube/TikTok Hooks

      ```
      First 3 seconds critical:

      VIDEO HOOKS:
      - Movement immediately
      - Face close-up
      - Text on screen
      - Sound pattern interrupt

      VERBAL HOOKS:
      - "Stop scrolling if..."
      - "Nobody talks about..."
      - "I tried X so you don't have to"
      - Start mid-story
      ```

      ### 4. Email Subject Lines

      | Type | Example |
      |------|---------|

      | Specific | "23% increase in 6 weeks" |
      | Pattern break | "RE: Your proposal" |

      ## Curiosity Gap Framework

      ### 1. The Gap Structure

      ```
      CURIOSITY = (What they want to know) - (What they know)

      Create gap by:
      1. Revealing a gap exists
      2. Promising to close it
      3. Making the answer irresistible
      ```

      ### 2. Gap Techniques

      | Technique | How | Example |
      |-----------|-----|---------|
      | Withhold key info | Leave out crucial detail | "One word changed everything" |
      | Promise revelation | Suggest secret | "The truth about X" |
      | Contrast | Show before/after | "From broke to $1M" |
      | Incomplete story | Start mid-action | "Just got off the phone..." |

      ### 3. Gap Calibration

      ```
      Too small gap:
      - Already know the answer
      - Obvious conclusion
      - No mystery

      Too large gap:
      - Can't imagine answer
      - Feels impossible
      - Disconnected from them

      Perfect gap:
      - Know enough to care
      - Can't predict answer
      - Believe answer exists
      ```

      ### 4. Payoff Rules

      | Gap Size | Required Payoff |
      |----------|-----------------|
      | Small | Satisfying |
      | Medium | Valuable |
      | Large | Mind-blowing |

      ```
      CRITICAL:
      Always deliver on the hook.
      Under-promise, over-deliver.
      Broken promises = lost trust.
      ```

      ## Pattern Interrupt Design

      ### 1. Why Interrupts Work

      ```
      Brain automates scrolling.
      Pattern interrupt = "Wait, what?"
      Conscious attention engaged.
      ```

      ### 2. Interrupt Techniques

      | Technique | Description | Example |
      |-----------|-------------|---------|
      | Contradiction | Say the opposite | "Don't read this post" |
      | Unexpected format | Break visual norm | Mid-sentence photo |
      | Meta-awareness | Acknowledge the medium | "You've seen 47 posts today" |
      | Emotional shift | Change expected emotion | Humor in serious topic |

      ### 3. Visual Interrupts

      ```
      THUMBNAIL PATTERNS:

      - Human faces (especially eyes)
      - Bright/contrasting colors
      - Text overlay (minimal)
      - Unusual angles
      - Before/after splits
      - Expressions (surprise, confusion)
      ```

      ### 4. Audio Interrupts

      | Technique | Use |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Silence break | Unexpected pause |
      | Sound effect | Distinct audio cue |
      | Tonal shift | Change in voice |
      | Music stop | Pattern break |
