      ## World-Building Framework

      ### 1. Foundation Layer

      ```
      Core questions to answer:

      SETTING
      - When and where?
      - What are the rules?
      - What's different from our world?

      HISTORY
      - How did this world get here?
      - What key events shaped it?
      - What conflicts exist?

      CULTURE
      - What do people believe?
      - How do they organize?
      - What do they value?
      ```

      ### 2. Depth Layers

      | Layer | Visibility | Purpose |
      |-------|------------|---------|
      | Surface | Everyone sees | Entry point |
      | Standard | Most discover | Engagement |
      | Deep | Explorers find | Reward curiosity |
      | Hidden | Few discover | Create legends |

      ### 3. Consistency Bible

      ```
      Document everything:

      RULES
      - What's possible?
      - What's impossible?
      - What are the costs?

      FACTS
      - Names, dates, places
      - Relationships
      - Events

      AESTHETICS
      - Visual language
      - Tone and mood
      - Vocabulary
      ```

      ### 4. The Iceberg Principle

      ```
              ▲
             /│\  ← What you show (10%)
            / │ \
      ─────/──│──\─────── surface
          /   │   \
         /    │    \
        /     │     \  ← What you know (90%)
       /      │      \
      └───────┴───────┘

      Know 10x more than you show.
      This creates coherent depth.
      ```
