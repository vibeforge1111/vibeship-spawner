    summary: Changing established lore badly
    severity: high
    situation: Retconning breaks fan investment
    why: |
      Need to fix something.
      New idea contradicts old.
      Didn't plan ahead.

      ## Retcon Management

      ### Types of Retcons

      | Type | Description | Fan Reaction |
      |------|-------------|--------------|
      | Addition | New info compatible | Usually positive |
      | Alteration | Modifying details | Mixed |
      | Contradiction | Directly conflicts | Usually negative |
      | Erasure | Removing canon | Often rage |

      ### When Retcons Work

      ```
      Acceptable retcons:

      - Fills plot hole
      - Improves story
      - Community wants it
      - Done with care

      Unacceptable retcons:

      - Lazy writing
      - Corporate mandate
      - Erases beloved content
      - No acknowledgment
      ```

      ### Retcon Process

      | Step | Action |
      |------|--------|
      | 1 | Exhaust non-retcon options |
      | 2 | Identify what's affected |
      | 3 | Plan the transition |
      | 4 | Acknowledge the change |
      | 5 | Explain why (if possible) |

      ### Minimizing Damage

      ```
      If you must retcon:

      - Honor what came before
      - Give in-universe reason if possible
      - Don't pretend it didn't exist
      - Acknowledge fan investment
      - Make new version better
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Fan outcry
      - "Not my canon"
      - Trust erosion
    detection_pattern: "retcon|contradiction|didn't used to be"

  - id: lore-gatekeeping
    summary: Deep lore creating toxic expertise hierarchy
    severity: medium
    situation: "True fans" attacking newcomers
    why: |
      Lore depth creates insiders.
      Investment creates ownership.
      Community polices knowledge.
    solution: |
      ## Community Inclusion

      ### Gatekeeping Signs

      | Behavior | Problem |
      |----------|---------|
      | "You're not a real fan if..." | Exclusion |
      | Mocking basic questions | Intimidation |
      | Expertise as status | Hierarchy |
      | Quiz culture | Performance |

      ### Prevention Design

      ```
      Build inclusion into lore:

      - Clear entry points
      - No "required reading"
      - Celebrate new fans
      - Separate casual/deep
      - Multiple valid engagement levels
      ```

      ### Community Norms

      | Encourage | Discourage |
      |-----------|------------|
      | Welcoming newcomers | "Did you even read..." |
      | Sharing knowledge | Hoarding knowledge |
      | Multiple interpretations | "Actually, that's wrong" |
      | Joy in discovery | Spoiling for others |

      ### Lore Accessibility

      ```
      Create multiple levels:

      CASUAL
      - Enjoy without deep knowledge
      - Summary available
      - Not tested on details

      ENGAGED
      - Deeper exploration optional
      - Rewarded, not required
      - Self-paced discovery

      EXPERT
      - Community contribution
      - Theory crafting
      - No gatekeeping power
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Newcomers feel unwelcome
      - "You're not a real fan"
      - Community becomes insular
    detection_pattern: "true fan|didn't read|fake fan"

  - id: resolution-disappointment
    summary: Mystery answer disappoints
    severity: high
    situation: Hyped mystery has weak payoff
    why: |
      Promised more than could deliver.
      Community theories were better.
      Built up too much.
    solution: |
      ## Managing Mystery Payoff

      ### The Expectation Problem

      ```
      Long mysteries create:
      - High expectations
      - Elaborate theories
      - Emotional investment
      - Impossible standards

      Community often imagines
      better answers than you have.
      ```

      ### Calibration Strategies

      | Strategy | How |
      |----------|-----|
      | Don't over-hype | Manage expectations |
      | Faster resolution | Less buildup |
      | Multiple reveals | Distributed payoff |
      | Leave some open | Embrace ambiguity |

      ### Payoff Types

      ```
      Satisfying answers are:

      1. EARNED
         - Clues existed
         - Makes sense in retrospect
         - Rewards attention

      2. SURPRISING
         - Not obvious
         - Different than expected
         - But coherent

      3. MEANINGFUL
         - Stakes matter
         - Character impact
         - Thematic resonance
      ```

      ### The "Embrace Ambiguity" Option

      | Mystery Type | Resolution |
      |--------------|------------|
      | Plot | Usually needs answer |
      | Philosophical | Can stay open |
      | Historical | Can be lost to time |
      | Metaphysical | Multiple truths |
    symptoms:
      - "That's it?"
      - Fan theories were better
      - Disappointment threads
    detection_pattern: "disappointed|that's the answer|built up for nothing"

  - id: abandoned-threads
    summary: Started mysteries never resolved
    severity: medium
    situation: Lore threads left hanging forever
    why: |
      Created in the moment.
      Team changed.
      Priorities shifted.
    solution: |
      ## Thread Management

      ### Prevention

      ```
      Before creating mystery:

      1. Do you have an answer?
      2. Can you commit to resolution?
      3. Is this thread necessary?
      4. Who owns this thread?
      ```

      ### Thread Tracking

      | Thread | Status | Owner | Resolution Plan |
      |--------|--------|-------|-----------------|
      | Mystery A | Active | @name | Season 3 |
      | Mystery B | Background | @name | Optional |
      | Mystery C | Abandoned | - | Need decision |

      ### Resolution Options

      | Option | When |
      |--------|------|
      | Resolve as planned | Can deliver |
      | Quick resolution | Can't fully deliver |
      | Absorb into other thread | Related mystery exists |
      | Acknowledge abandonment | No good resolution |
      | In-universe loss | "Lost to history" |

      ### The Honest Approach

      ```
      If you can't resolve:

      - Don't pretend it didn't exist
      - Acknowledge in-universe or out
      - Let community create theories
      - Maybe community answer becomes canon
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "What happened to X?"
      - Forgotten plotlines
      - Community confusion
    detection_pattern: "never resolved|what about|forgotten"
