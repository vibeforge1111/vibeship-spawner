      2. Diverse team input
      3. Community feedback loops
      4. Regular edge recalibration
      ```

    summary: Absurdist character becoming inconsistent
    severity: medium
    situation: Brand voice varies wildly between posts
    why: |
      Multiple people creating.
      No character guide.
      Trend-chasing overrode character.
    solution: |
      ## Character Consistency

      ### Character Bible

      ```
      Document the character:

      CORE IDENTITY
      - Who is this character?
      - What do they want?
      - How do they see the world?

      VOICE
      - How do they speak?
      - What words do they use?
      - What's their energy?

      BOUNDARIES
      - What would they never say?
      - What topics do they avoid?
      - What's their line?
      ```

      ### Content Validation

      | Check | Question |
      |-------|----------|
      | Voice | "Does this sound like them?" |
      | Action | "Would they do this?" |
      | Topic | "Would they care about this?" |
      | Tone | "Is the energy right?" |

      ### Team Alignment

      ```
      Keep team consistent:

      1. Onboarding includes character training
      2. Regular voice calibration sessions
      3. Examples of on/off voice
      4. Central voice owner
      ```

      ### Evolution vs Drift

      | Evolution (Good) | Drift (Bad) |
      |------------------|-------------|
      | Intentional growth | Accidental change |

    symptoms:
      - "This doesn't sound like you"
      - Engagement varies wildly
      - Brand feels fragmented
