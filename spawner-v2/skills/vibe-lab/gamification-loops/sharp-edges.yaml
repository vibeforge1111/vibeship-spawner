# Gamification Loops Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: addiction-not-engagement
    summary: Creating harmful addiction instead of healthy engagement
    severity: high
    situation: Gamification that users can't put down even when they want to
    why: |
      Metrics look great.
      Users feel trapped.
      Long-term backlash.
    solution: |
      ## Ethical Engagement Design

      ### Addiction vs Engagement

      | Addiction | Healthy Engagement |
      |-----------|-------------------|
      | Feel trapped | Feel empowered |
      | Guilt when stopping | Satisfaction when done |
      | Compulsive | Intentional |
      | Escape reality | Enhance reality |
      | Regret after | Pride after |

      ### Design Checks

      ```
      For each mechanic, ask:

      1. Can user stop without penalty?
      2. Does user feel good after using?
      3. Does this respect user's time?
      4. Would I want my family using this?
      5. Are we transparent about mechanics?
      ```

      ### Healthy Design Patterns

      | Pattern | Implementation |
      |---------|----------------|
      | Session limits | "Take a break?" |
      | Completion points | Natural stopping points |
      | Time transparency | "You've been here X min" |
      | Goal completion | Finite daily goals |
      | Off-ramps | Easy to disengage |

      ### Red Line Mechanics

      ```
      Never use:

      - Punishment for not engaging
      - FOMO for basic features
      - Hidden addiction mechanics
      - Infinite scrolling rewards
      - Guilt-based retention
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Users complain about time spent
      - Usage patterns show compulsion
      - Negative user reviews about "addiction"
    detection_pattern: "can't stop|addicted|waste time|feel bad"

  - id: metric-gaming
    summary: Users gaming the system instead of engaging genuinely
    severity: medium
    situation: Gamification rewards wrong behaviors
    why: |
      Reward what you measure.
      Users optimize for rewards.
      Intended behavior ignored.
    solution: |
      ## Anti-Gaming Design

      ### Common Gaming Patterns

      | Mechanic | Gaming Behavior |
      |----------|-----------------|
      | Points for posts | Spam posts |
      | Badge for comments | Low-effort comments |
      | Streak for login | Login without engaging |
      | Leaderboard | Bot/alt accounts |

      ### Prevention Strategies

      ```
      1. MEASURE OUTCOMES, NOT ACTIONS
         - Quality, not quantity
         - Impact, not activity
         - Completion, not starts

      2. DELAYED REWARDS
         - Time before counting
         - Verification period
         - Quality checks

      3. SOCIAL VALIDATION
         - Peer-dependent rewards
         - Community moderation
         - Reputation weighting
      ```

      ### Reward Design Principles

      | Instead of | Try |
      |------------|-----|
      | Points per action | Points for value created |
      | Badge for doing | Badge for achieving |
      | Streak for showing up | Streak for meaningful engagement |

      ### Detection and Response

      ```
      Monitor for:
      - Sudden behavior changes
      - Minimum viable actions
      - Bot-like patterns
      - Reward-only engagement

      Response:
      - Adjust mechanics
      - Add quality gates
      - Remove gameable elements
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Low quality increases
      - Obvious gaming patterns
      - Engagement without value
    detection_pattern: "gaming the system|cheating|exploiting"

  - id: motivation-crowding
    summary: External rewards destroying internal motivation
    severity: high
    situation: Users who loved activity now only do it for rewards
    why: |
      Psychology is real.
      Overjustification effect.
      Can't easily reverse.
    solution: |
      ## Protecting Intrinsic Motivation

      ### The Overjustification Effect

      ```
      What happens:

      Before rewards: "I do this because I enjoy it"
      After rewards: "I do this for the points"
      Remove rewards: "Why would I do this?"

      External rewards can PERMANENTLY
      reduce intrinsic motivation.
      ```

      ### When Rewards Help vs Hurt

      | Situation | Reward Impact |
      |-----------|---------------|
      | Boring task | Helps |
      | Already enjoyed | Hurts |
      | Building habit | Helps initially |
      | Creative work | Usually hurts |
      | Social good | Mixed |

      ### Safe Reward Patterns

      ```
      Rewards that don't crowd out:

      INFORMATIONAL
      - Feedback on performance
      - Skill indication
      - Progress visibility

      UNEXPECTED
      - Surprise bonuses
      - Random appreciation
      - Not contingent on action

      SOCIAL
      - Recognition from peers
      - Community status
      - Shared achievements
      ```

      ### Recovery Strategies

      | If motivation crowded | Response |
      |-----------------------|----------|
      | Early detection | Reduce reward salience |
      | Moderate | Shift to informational |
      | Severe | Remove rewards entirely |
    symptoms:
      - Only engage for rewards
      - Stop when rewards stop
      - "Why should I if no points?"
    detection_pattern: "only for points|no reward|what do I get"

  - id: leaderboard-demoralization
    summary: Competition that discourages instead of motivates
    severity: medium
    situation: Leaderboard demotivates majority of users
    why: |
      Only top benefits.
      Rest feels hopeless.
      Creates two classes.
    solution: |
      ## Healthy Competition Design

      ### The Leaderboard Problem

      ```
      Standard leaderboard:

      Top 10%: Motivated (winners)
      Next 20%: Somewhat motivated
      Middle 40%: Indifferent
      Bottom 30%: Demotivated (give up)

      Net effect often NEGATIVE.
      ```

      ### Alternative Competition Models

      | Model | How It Works |
      |-------|--------------|
      | Personal best | Compete with yourself |
      | Cohort | Compete with similar skill |
      | Team | Compete as groups |
      | Time-limited | Fresh starts regularly |
      | Opt-in | Only those who want |

      ### Healthy Competition Patterns

      ```
      1. TIERED LEAGUES
         - Compete with equals
         - Promotion/relegation
         - Everyone can "win"

      2. RELATIVE PROGRESS
         - "You improved X%"
         - "Better than last week"
         - Personal focus

      3. COLLABORATIVE COMPETITION
         - Team achievements
         - Community goals
         - Shared wins
      ```

      ### Implementation

      | Feature | Purpose |
      |---------|---------|
      | Hide full rankings | Reduce comparison |
      | Show nearby | Achievable goals |
      | Regular resets | Fresh chances |
      | Opt-out option | Respect preference |
    symptoms:
      - Low-ranked users disengage
      - Same people always win
      - Complaints about fairness
    detection_pattern: "can't compete|always lose|unfair"
