cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Distributed Systems
    insight: "CAP theorem applies - you cannot have perfect consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously"
    application: |
      Trading systems often choose AP (availability + partition tolerance):
      - Accept eventual consistency in position tracking
      - Use reconciliation processes to detect discrepancies
      - Design for graceful degradation during network partitions
      - Implement idempotent order submission to handle retries

  - domain: Data Engineering
    insight: "Data quality is the foundation - garbage in, garbage out applies 10x to financial data"
    application: |
      Critical data pipeline considerations:
      - Validate tick data for gaps, outliers, corporate actions
      - Implement data lineage tracking for audit trails
      - Use point-in-time databases to prevent lookahead bias
      - Build real-time data quality monitoring with alerting

  - domain: Security Engineering
    insight: "Defense in depth - multiple layers of protection against breaches and errors"
    application: |
      Trading system security layers:
      - API key rotation and secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
      - Order validation at multiple points (client, gateway, exchange)
      - Position limits enforced at infrastructure level, not just code
      - Audit logging of all order events for compliance and debugging

  - domain: Site Reliability Engineering
    insight: "Observability is essential - you cannot fix what you cannot see"
    application: |
      Trading observability stack:
      - Distributed tracing for order flow (Jaeger, Zipkin)
      - Metrics dashboards (latency percentiles, fill rates, slippage)
      - Structured logging with correlation IDs
      - Anomaly detection on trading patterns (circuit breakers)
