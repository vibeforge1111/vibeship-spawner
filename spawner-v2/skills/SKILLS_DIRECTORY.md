## Paul Graham Layer (Founder Wisdom) 📜

*Distilled from PG's essays. Consolidated into actionable skill clusters that work together.*

| Skill | Status | Description | Essays Combined |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `idea-maze` | 📋 Planned | Finding ideas worth building. Live in the future and notice what's missing. Schlep blindness (find painful problems others avoid). Organic ideas from lived experience > brainstormed ideas. Frighteningly ambitious thinking. The "would users be very disappointed" test. | "How to Get Startup Ideas", "Schlep Blindness", "Organic Startup Ideas", "Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas" |
| `founder-character` | 📋 Planned | The traits that predict success. Relentlessly resourceful (adaptable problem-solvers who don't stop). Fierce nerds (intellectual intensity + competitiveness + curiosity). Earnestness (genuine belief, not cynicism). Mean people fail (reputation is long-term strategy). Keep identity small (no ego attachment to positions). | "Relentlessly Resourceful", "Fierce Nerds", "Earnestness", "Mean People Fail", "Keep Your Identity Small" |
| `early-stage-hustle` | 📋 Planned | The pre-scale playbook. Do things that don't scale (manual onboarding, concierge MVP, Airbnb-style hustle). Talk to users obsessively. Launch before you're ready. Make something people want. Recruit users one by one. The unsexy work that creates escape velocity. | "Do Things That Don't Scale", "How to Get Startup Ideas", "Launch Fast" |
| `founder-operating-system` | 📋 Planned | How to work effectively. Maker's schedule vs manager's schedule (protect deep work). Default alive math (runway determines decisions). How to lose time and money (recognize slow death). Writing clearly = thinking clearly. Disagree and commit (strong opinions, loosely held). | "Maker's Schedule", "Default Alive or Default Dead", "How to Lose Time and Money", "Write Like You Talk", "How to Disagree" |
| `taste-and-craft` | 📋 Planned | Building things that matter. Taste for makers (knowing good vs knowing why). Six principles: simple, clean, bold, timeless. Be good (ethics as moat). Submarine (when to be stealthy vs loud). Quality over quantity. The details that separate great from good. | "Taste for Makers", "Six Principles for Making New Things", "Be Good", "Submarine" |
