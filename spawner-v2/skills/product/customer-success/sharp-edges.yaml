# Customer Success Sharp Edges
# The retention mistakes that kill growth

sharp_edges:
  - id: onboarding-abandonment
    summary: Complex onboarding that users never complete
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      15-step onboarding flow. Completion rate is 20%. Users who complete
      retain at 80%. Users who do not complete churn at 90%. Most value
      never delivered.
    why: |
      Every step is friction. Users have limited patience. If they do not
      reach value quickly, they leave. Front-load value, minimize steps.
    solution: |
      Minimum viable onboarding:

      1. Single key action to value (under 5 minutes)
      2. Progressive disclosure of advanced features
      3. Measure step completion rates
      4. Remove steps with high drop-off

      The goal is first value moment, not complete understanding.
    symptoms:
      - Low onboarding completion rate
      - High early churn
      - Many steps before value
      - Users asking basic questions after onboarding

  - id: lagging-indicator-blindness
    summary: Only measuring revenue, missing leading indicators
    severity: high
    situation: |
      MRR looks fine. Suddenly drops 30% in a month. Team surprised. Actually
      engagement had been declining for months. Nobody was watching.
    why: |
      Revenue is a lagging indicator. By the time it drops, damage is done.
      Leading indicators give warning. Engagement, feature adoption, support
      sentiment - these predict revenue changes.
    solution: |
      Leading indicator dashboard:

      Daily: Active users, key feature usage
      Weekly: Feature adoption, support ticket sentiment
      Monthly: NPS trends, health score distribution

      Alert on leading indicator drops before revenue impact.
    symptoms:
      - Only tracking revenue metrics
      - Surprised by churn
      - No engagement tracking
      - Reactive not proactive

  - id: peanut-butter-spreading
    summary: Same success effort for all customers regardless of value
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Enterprise customer worth $100K/year gets same attention as $50/month
      self-serve customer. Enterprise churns for lack of attention.
      Self-serve customers get more time than they are worth.
    why: |
      Success resources are finite. Spreading evenly ignores economics.
      High-value customers need high-touch. Low-value customers need
      efficient self-serve. Match effort to customer value.
    solution: |
      Tiered success model:

      Enterprise ($50K+): Dedicated CSM, quarterly business reviews
      Mid-market ($1K-50K): Shared CSM, monthly check-ins
      SMB ($100-1K): Tech-touch, automated sequences
      Self-serve (under $100): Community and self-help

      Calculate cost-to-serve vs customer value for each tier.
    symptoms:
      - Same approach for all customers
      - Enterprise customers feel neglected
      - Too much time on low-value accounts
      - No tier definitions

  - id: health-score-fiction
    summary: Health scores that do not actually predict churn
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Health score shows green. Customer churns. Score was based on logins,
      not actual value delivery. Looked healthy, was not.
    why: |
      Health scores are only useful if they predict outcomes. Many scores
      measure activity, not value. Validate your score against actual
      churn data. Iterate until predictive.
    solution: |
      Health score validation:

      1. Run retrospective analysis on churned customers
      2. What did their health scores look like 30, 60, 90 days before churn?
      3. What signals did we miss?
      4. Add those signals to the score
      5. Test prediction accuracy monthly

      A score that does not predict is worse than no score.
    symptoms:
      - Churns from green accounts
      - No retrospective on churned customers
      - Score never updated
      - Activity-based not value-based

  - id: renewal-surprise
    summary: Only engaging at renewal time
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Ignore customer for 11 months. Suddenly engage at renewal. Customer
      has already decided to leave. Too late. Discount offered in desperation.
    why: |
      Renewal is an outcome, not an activity. The decision happens throughout
      the relationship. Quarterly business reviews, ongoing value delivery,
      proactive engagement - these determine renewal.
    solution: |
      Renewal is earned throughout the year:

      Quarterly: Business review, success metrics review
      Monthly: Check-in on goals and blockers
      Ongoing: Product education, feature announcements
      At renewal: Celebration of value delivered, expansion discussion

      No surprises at renewal because relationship is continuous.
    symptoms:
      - Renewal outreach only near end date
      - Low renewal rate
      - Customers surprised by renewal
      - No QBRs or regular touchpoints

  - id: success-vs-support-confusion
    summary: Customer success doing support, not success
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      CSM spends all day answering how-to questions. No time for strategic
      conversations. Customers trained to use CSM as support. No proactive
      success happening.
    why: |
      Success and support are different functions. Success is proactive and
      strategic. Support is reactive and tactical. When success does support,
      nobody does success.
    solution: |
      Clear role separation:

      Support: Reactive, tactical, how-to questions
      Success: Proactive, strategic, business outcomes

      Escalation paths:
      - Technical issues go to support
      - Strategy questions go to success

      Train customers on correct routing from onboarding.
    symptoms:
      - CSMs answering how-to questions
      - No time for strategic conversations
      - CSM as glorified support
      - No proactive outreach happening

  - id: expansion-as-sales
    summary: Expansion conversations that feel like sales pitches
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Customer happy with product. CSM pushes upgrade aggressively. Customer
      feels sold to. Trust damaged. Actually churns instead of expanding.
    why: |
      Expansion should feel like helping, not selling. When customers outgrow
      their tier, expansion is natural. Pushing before they are ready damages
      the relationship.
    solution: |
      Expansion through value:

      1. Track usage vs plan limits
      2. When approaching limits, explain options
      3. Frame as solution to their growth, not your revenue
      4. If not ready, back off gracefully

      Natural expansion signals:
      - Hitting usage limits
      - Asking about features in higher tiers
      - Adding users or use cases
    symptoms:
      - Aggressive upsell attempts
      - Customers complain about sales pressure
      - Expansion damages relationships
      - Pushing before usage supports it

  - id: ignoring-power-users
    summary: All focus on at-risk, none on advocates
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      All CSM time on saving at-risk accounts. Happy customers ignored.
      Power users never asked to refer, review, or expand. Advocacy
      opportunity missed.
    why: |
      Happy customers are an asset. They can refer, review, case study,
      expand. Ignoring them leaves revenue and advocacy on the table.
      Balanced attention to risk and opportunity.
    solution: |
      Advocate program:

      Identify happy customers (NPS 9-10, high health, frequent users)
      Ask for: Referrals, reviews, case studies, references
      Reward: Early access, exclusive events, recognition

      Time allocation: 70% at-risk, 30% advocates (or adjust based on data)
    symptoms:
      - All focus on red accounts
      - No referral asks
      - No case studies being created
      - Happy customers feel ignored

  - id: manual-scale-failure
    summary: Trying to scale customer success manually
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      100 customers per CSM. Impossible to give everyone attention.
      Important tasks slip. Quality drops. Team burns out.
    why: |
      Human touch cannot scale linearly. Automation, playbooks, and tech-touch
      must handle low-touch segments. CSM time reserved for high-touch and
      exceptions.
    solution: |
      Scalable success:

      Automate: Onboarding sequences, usage-based nudges, renewal reminders
      Playbooks: Standardized responses to common situations
      Self-serve: Knowledge base, community, in-app guidance

      CSM time only for:
      - High-value strategic conversations
      - Complex escalations
      - Expansion opportunities
    symptoms:
      - CSM overwhelmed
      - Inconsistent experience
      - Manual processes for everything
      - No automation in place
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: churn-learning-gap
    summary: Not learning from churned customers
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Customer churns. Marked as closed-lost. No investigation. Same
      problems keep causing churn. Pattern never identified.
    why: |
      Every churn is a learning opportunity. Why did they leave? What
      could we have done differently? Without learning, the same problems
      cause the same churn forever.
    solution: |
      Churn investigation process:

      1. Exit interview (even if brief)
      2. Review health score history
      3. Review support and CSM interactions
      4. Identify: Was this preventable? How?
      5. Monthly churn patterns review
      6. Product and process changes based on learnings
    symptoms:
      - No exit interviews
      - No churn pattern analysis
      - Same reasons keep causing churn
      - Churn seen as inevitable
