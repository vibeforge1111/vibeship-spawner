# Feature Prioritization Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: framework-worship
    summary: Over-relying on prioritization formulas
    severity: medium
    situation: Prioritization score doesn't match intuition
    why: |
      Frameworks are tools, not truth.
      Garbage in, garbage out.
      Strategic context matters.
    solution: |
      ## Balanced Framework Use

      ### Framework Limitations

      ```
      RICE score is only as good as:
      - Your reach estimates
      - Your impact guesses
      - Your confidence calibration
      - Your effort predictions

      All of these are uncertain.
      ```

      ### Framework + Judgment

      | Framework Says | But Consider |
      |----------------|--------------|
      | High score | Strategic fit? Timing? Dependencies? |
      | Low score | Hidden strategic value? Customer signal? |
      | Tie | What does gut say? Why? |

      ### When to Override

      ```
      Override framework when:
      - Strategic importance not captured
      - Market timing critical
      - Customer relationship at stake
      - Clear blocker to other priorities
      - Intuition strongly disagrees (investigate why)
      ```

      ### Calibration Practice

      | Check | Frequency |
      |-------|-----------|
      | Estimates vs actuals | Every quarter |
      | Framework results vs outcomes | Every quarter |
      | Where overrides happened | Monthly |

      ### Framework as Discussion Tool

      Best use of frameworks:
      - Structure the discussion
      - Surface assumptions
      - Enable comparison
      - NOT: auto-generate priority list
    symptoms:
      - "But the score says..."
      - Strategic items deprioritized
      - Framework gaming
    detection_pattern: "RICE|ICE|framework score"

  - id: stakeholder-whiplash
    summary: Priorities changing constantly
    severity: high
    situation: Team can't finish anything due to shifting priorities
    why: |
      No clear decision process.
      Everyone can reprioritize.
      Leadership changes mind.
    solution: |
      ## Priority Stability

      ### Stability Rules

      ```
      Commitment Windows:
      - Sprint: Locked (no changes except emergency)
      - Month: Stable (rare changes)
      - Quarter: Mostly stable (roadmap items)

      Changes require:
      - Clear business reason
      - Trade-off acknowledged
      - Team informed properly
      ```

      ### Change Request Process

      ```
      Priority change request:

      1. Requestor fills out form:
         - What's changing
         - Why (business impact)
         - What to deprioritize
         - Urgency

      2. Review against criteria
      3. Decide with trade-off explicit
      4. Communicate to team
      5. Document in decision log
      ```

      ### Change Thresholds

      | Impact | Can Be Done By | Process |
      |--------|----------------|---------|
      | Minor (within sprint) | PM | Inform team |
      | Medium (roadmap item) | PM + stakeholders | Review meeting |
      | Major (strategy shift) | Leadership | Planning revision |

      ### Tracking Churn

      ```
      Measure:
      - # of priority changes per sprint
      - # of interrupted initiatives
      - Scope added mid-sprint

      Target: < 2 priority changes per quarter
      ```

      ### Push Back Template

      "I understand the urgency of [new request].
       If we do this now, we'd need to stop [current work].
       The trade-off is [consequences].
       Are you comfortable with that trade-off?"
    symptoms:
      - Multiple pivots per sprint
      - Nothing gets completed
      - Team frustration
    detection_pattern: "priority change|urgent|stop and switch"

  - id: loudest-voice-wins
    summary: Prioritizing based on who asks loudest
    severity: high
    situation: Squeaky wheel gets the grease
    why: |
      Path of least resistance.
      Avoiding conflict.
      No objective criteria.
    solution: |
      ## Objective Prioritization

      ### Make Criteria Explicit

      ```
      Published prioritization criteria:

      1. Strategic alignment (weight: 30%)
      2. Customer impact (weight: 25%)
      3. Revenue impact (weight: 20%)
      4. Effort required (weight: 15%)
      5. Urgency (weight: 10%)

      Anyone can understand how decisions are made.
      ```

      ### Request vs Priority

      | What They Say | What to Assess |
      |---------------|----------------|
      | "Urgent!" | What's the actual deadline? |
      | "Critical customer!" | Revenue at stake? Evidence? |
      | "Everyone wants this!" | How many? How badly? |
      | "Competitors have it!" | Do customers care? |

      ### Evidence Requirements

      ```
      To prioritize, requestor provides:

      - Problem statement
      - Affected customers (how many)
      - Business impact (quantified)
      - Current workaround
      - Urgency reason

      No evidence = no prioritization change
      ```

      ### Fairness Perception

      Even if you can't make everyone happy:
      - Process is transparent
      - Criteria are published
      - Decisions are explained
      - Anyone can see reasoning

      ### Pushing Back on Loud Voices

      "I hear the urgency. Help me understand:
       - How many customers affected?
       - What's the business impact?
       - What happens if we wait?"
    symptoms:
      - Same stakeholders always win
      - Quiet teams never get priority
      - Decisions feel political
    detection_pattern: "escalation|urgent|important stakeholder"

  - id: ignoring-strategic-fit
    summary: Prioritizing only by immediate value
    severity: medium
    situation: Roadmap is all quick wins, no strategic investment
    why: |
      Short-term bias.
      Easier to justify.
      Pressure for immediate results.
    solution: |
      ## Strategic Balance

      ### Investment Allocation

      ```
      Typical healthy balance:

      70% - Sustaining (current product/customers)
      20% - Strategic (future bets)
      10% - Exploration (learning, experiments)

      Adjust based on company stage.
      ```

      ### Strategic Project Protection

      ```
      Strategic initiatives get:
      - Protected time allocation
      - Longer measurement window
      - Different success criteria
      - Leadership sponsorship

      Don't compete with tactical on same criteria.
      ```

      ### Portfolio View

      | Category | This Quarter | Next Quarter |
      |----------|--------------|--------------|
      | Sustaining | [list] | [list] |
      | Strategic | [list] | [list] |
      | Exploration | [list] | [list] |

      Check: Is strategic getting attention?

      ### Avoiding Strategic Drift

      Monthly check:
      - Are strategic initiatives progressing?
      - Have they been deprioritized?
      - Is the balance right?

      ### Long-term vs Short-term Framing

      | Decision | Short-term | Long-term |
      |----------|------------|-----------|
      | [Feature X] | Low impact | Platform value |
      | [Feature Y] | High impact | Dead end |

      Include long-term view in evaluation.
    symptoms:
      - All tactical, no strategic
      - Strategic initiatives keep slipping
      - No progress on big bets
    detection_pattern: "strategic|long-term|investment"

  - id: scope-creep
    summary: Features growing beyond original scope
    severity: medium
    situation: Simple feature becomes complex project
    why: |
      Good ideas added.
      Edge cases discovered.
      Stakeholders add requirements.
    solution: |
      ## Scope Control

      ### Scope Definition Upfront

      ```
      Feature Brief includes:

      IN SCOPE:
      - [Specific functionality]
      - [Specific functionality]

      OUT OF SCOPE:
      - [Explicitly excluded]
      - [Explicitly excluded]

      SUCCESS CRITERIA:
      - [Measurable outcome]
      ```

      ### Scope Change Process

      ```
      When scope addition requested:

      1. Assess size (trivial, small, significant)
      2. Trivial: PM decides, informs
      3. Small: Team discusses impact
      4. Significant: Separate initiative or trade-off

      Never just add without considering impact.
      ```

      ### MVP Discipline

      ```
      For each feature, ask:
      - What's the smallest thing that delivers value?
      - What can we learn before building more?
      - What can we add later if successful?

      Version 1 < Version 2 < Version 3
      ```

      ### Scope Creep Signals

      | Signal | Response |
      |--------|----------|
      | "While we're here..." | "Separate item, prioritize later" |
      | "Just one more thing..." | "What do we cut instead?" |
      | "Edge case X..." | "Handle separately if significant" |

      ### Time-Boxing

      Alternative to scope control:
      - Fix time (2 weeks)
      - Flex scope (build what fits)
      - Ship, then iterate
    symptoms:
      - Estimates keep growing
      - "Just one more thing"
      - Features never ship
    detection_pattern: "scope|add|also want"
