      ## Framework Selection Guide

      ### 1. Framework Overview

      | Framework | Best For | Key Factors |
      |-----------|----------|-------------|
      | RICE | Feature prioritization | Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort |
      | ICE | Experiments | Impact, Confidence, Ease |
      | Value/Effort | Quick decisions | 2x2 matrix |
      | MoSCoW | Scope decisions | Must, Should, Could, Won't |
      | Kano | Customer satisfaction | Delighters, Performers, Basics |
      | Weighted Scoring | Complex decisions | Custom criteria |
      | Cost of Delay | Time-sensitive | Urgency and value decay |

      ### 2. RICE Framework

      ```
      Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

      Reach: # of customers affected per quarter
      Impact: 3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low
      Confidence: 100% = high, 80% = medium, 50% = low
      Effort: Person-months of work
      ```

      **Example**
      | Feature | Reach | Impact | Conf | Effort | Score |
      |---------|-------|--------|------|--------|-------|
      | Feature A | 5000 | 2 | 80% | 3 | 2667 |
      | Feature B | 2000 | 3 | 100% | 1 | 6000 |

      ### 3. Impact/Effort Matrix

      ```
                 High Impact
                     │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         │ Quick     │ Major     │
         │ Wins      │ Projects  │
         │ (Do now)  │ (Plan)    │
       Low──────────────────────High Effort
         │ Fill-ins  │ Avoid     │
         │ (Maybe)   │ (No)      │
         └───────────┼───────────┘
                 Low Impact
      ```

      ### 4. Cost of Delay

      ```
      CD3 = Cost of Delay / Duration

      Cost of Delay includes:
      - Revenue lost per week
      - Customer churn risk
      - Competitive risk
      - Compliance deadlines

      Prioritize highest CD3 first.
      ```

      ### 5. Kano Model

      | Category | Effect on Satisfaction |
      |----------|------------------------|
      | Basic | Expected; absence causes dissatisfaction |
      | Performance | More is better, linear |
      | Delighter | Unexpected positive surprise |

      **Prioritization Rule**
      Basic > Performance > Delighter (usually)

      ### 6. When to Use What

      | Situation | Framework |
      |-----------|-----------|
      | Quarterly planning | RICE |
      | Sprint decisions | Value/Effort |
      | Release scoping | MoSCoW |
      | Growth experiments | ICE |
      | Time-sensitive | Cost of Delay |
      | Complex trade-offs | Weighted Scoring |

      ## Roadmap Best Practices

      ### 1. Roadmap Types

      | Type | Audience | Timeframe | Detail |
      |------|----------|-----------|--------|
      | Now/Next/Later | Internal | 3-6 months | Low |
      | Theme-based | Leadership | 6-12 months | Themes, not features |
      | Feature-based | Delivery team | 1-3 months | High |
      | Portfolio | C-suite | 12+ months | Strategic bets |

      ### 2. Now/Next/Later Framework

      ```
      NOW (Committed)
      - Currently building
      - High confidence
      - Specific scope

      NEXT (Planned)
      - Coming soon
      - Medium confidence
      - May change

      LATER (Exploring)
      - Under consideration
      - Low confidence
      - Will change
      ```

      ### 3. Roadmap Content

      **Include**
      - Outcomes/goals, not just features
      - Strategic context (why)
      - Dependencies if critical
      - Confidence levels

      **Exclude**
      - Fixed dates (use timeframes)
      - Everything (be selective)
      - Implementation details
      - Commitments beyond capacity

      ### 4. Roadmap Presentation

      ```
      For each initiative:

      [Theme Name]
      Goal: What outcome we're driving
      Why now: Why this is prioritized
      Approach: High-level how
      Success: How we'll measure
      Confidence: High/Medium/Low
      ```

      ### 5. Roadmap Cadence

      | Activity | Frequency |
      |----------|-----------|
      | Internal review | Weekly |
      | Team update | Every sprint |
      | Stakeholder share | Monthly |
      | Major revision | Quarterly |

      ### 6. Managing Roadmap Requests

      ```
      When stakeholder requests addition:

      1. Understand the problem
      2. Assess against criteria
      3. Show trade-offs ("What would we deprioritize?")
      4. Decide transparently
      5. Document decision
      ```

      ## Stakeholder Management

      ### 1. Stakeholder Mapping

      ```
                 High Influence
                     │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         │ Keep      │ Manage    │
         │ Satisfied │ Closely   │
         │           │           │
       Low──────────────────────High Interest
         │ Monitor   │ Keep      │
         │           │ Informed  │
         └───────────┼───────────┘
                 Low Influence
      ```

      ### 2. Input Collection

      **Before Planning**
      - 1:1 conversations with key stakeholders
      - Input request form for structured feedback
      - Review business metrics and goals

      **During Planning**
      - Draft prioritization (PM-led)
      - Review with key stakeholders
      - Incorporate feedback
      - Finalize and share

      ### 3. Priority Disagreement

      ```
      When stakeholders disagree:

      1. Ensure shared understanding of goals
      2. Make criteria explicit
      3. Show data/evidence
      4. Clarify trade-offs
      5. Escalate if needed (with recommendation)
      ```

      ### 4. Saying No

      **The "No" Framework**
      ```
      "I understand [their goal].
       Here's why [alternative/no]:
       [Evidence/reasoning].
       What I'd suggest instead:
       [Alternative approach]."
      ```

      **Types of No**
      - Not now (prioritize later)
      - Not this way (different solution)
      - Not at all (doesn't fit strategy)

      ### 5. Communication Plan

      | Stakeholder | What They Need | Frequency |
      |-------------|----------------|-----------|
      | Executives | Strategic alignment | Monthly |
      | Sales | What's coming for customers | Monthly |
      | Support | Upcoming changes | Every release |
      | Engineering | Clear priorities | Weekly |

  - name: Backlog Management
    description: Keeping backlog healthy and useful
    when_to_use: Ongoing backlog hygiene
    implementation: |
      ## Backlog Best Practices

      ### 1. Backlog Structure

      ```
      Backlog Tiers:

      Tier 1: Now (This sprint)
      - Fully refined
      - Ready to build
      - Clear acceptance criteria

      Tier 2: Next (Next 1-2 sprints)
      - Mostly refined
      - Scope understood
      - Needs detail

      Tier 3: Later (3+ sprints)
      - Rough idea
      - Needs discovery
      - May not happen
      ```

      ### 2. Backlog Grooming

      **Weekly Grooming**
      - Review Tier 1 readiness
      - Refine Tier 2 items
      - Promote/demote between tiers

      **Monthly Cleanup**
      - Archive stale items (6+ months untouched)
      - Re-prioritize Tier 3
      - Remove duplicates

      **Quarterly Purge**
      - Aggressive cleanup
      - Challenge everything in Tier 3
      - Align with roadmap

      ### 3. Backlog Size

      ```
      Healthy backlog size:
      - Tier 1: 2-3 sprints of work
      - Tier 2: 3-6 sprints of work
      - Tier 3: Minimal (ideas, not items)

      Total refined items: < 8-10 sprints

      Bigger = unmaintainable and demoralizing
      ```

      ### 4. Feature Request Handling

      ```
      Request comes in:

      1. Capture (don't lose it)
      2. Categorize (problem, feature, bug)
      3. Initial assess (quick value/effort)
      4. Merge if duplicate
      5. Decide: Tier 1/2/3 or Archive
      6. Communicate decision to requestor
      ```

      ### 5. Backlog Health Metrics

      | Metric | Healthy |
      |--------|---------|
      | Items added/week | Stable, not growing |
      | Items completed/week | ≥ Items added |
      | Avg age of Tier 3 | < 6 months |
      | % items refined | Tier 1: 100%, Tier 2: 70% |

  - name: Trade-off Analysis
    description: Making difficult prioritization decisions
    when_to_use: Hard either/or decisions
    implementation: |
      ## Trade-off Decision Framework

      ### 1. Trade-off Types

      | Trade-off | Example |
      |-----------|---------|
      | Speed vs Quality | Ship fast with debt vs wait for solid |
      | Breadth vs Depth | More features vs better features |
      | Short vs Long term | Quick win vs strategic investment |
      | Revenue vs Retention | New sales vs existing customers |

      ### 2. Trade-off Analysis Template

      ```
      Decision: [Feature A vs Feature B]

      Option A:
      - Benefits: [list]
      - Risks: [list]
      - Opportunity cost: [what we give up]

      Option B:
      - Benefits: [list]
      - Risks: [list]
      - Opportunity cost: [what we give up]

      Recommendation: [choice]
      Reasoning: [why]
      Reversibility: [how hard to change later]
      ```

      ### 3. Reversibility Principle

      ```
      Easy to reverse (type 2 decisions):
      - Decide quickly
      - Bias toward action
      - Learn and adjust

      Hard to reverse (type 1 decisions):
      - Take more time
      - Gather more input
      - Be more deliberate
      ```

      ### 4. Opportunity Cost Thinking

      Every yes is a no to something else.

      Ask: "What are we not doing by doing this?"

      Make trade-offs explicit, not hidden.

      ### 5. Decision Documentation

      ```
      Decision Log Entry:

      Date:
      Decision:
      Options considered:
      Evidence used:
      Trade-offs accepted:
      Decision maker:
      Review date:
      ```
