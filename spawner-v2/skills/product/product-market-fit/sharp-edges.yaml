  - id: pmf-survey-misuse
    summary: Running PMF survey incorrectly
    severity: high
    situation: PMF survey gives misleading results
    why: |
      Wrong respondents surveyed.
      Too few responses.
      Biased sample.
    solution: |
      ## Correct PMF Survey Execution

      ### Common Mistakes

      | Mistake | Result |
      |---------|--------|
      | Survey all signups | Includes people who never tried |
      | Only survey power users | Inflates score |
      | Too few responses | No statistical validity |
      | Leading introduction | Biases responses |

      ### Correct Protocol

      ```
      1. Define eligible respondents:
         - Used product 2+ times
         - Active in last 14 days
         - Experienced core value proposition

      2. Reach sufficient sample:
         - Minimum: 40 responses
         - Better: 100+ responses

      3. Avoid bias:
         - Neutral survey introduction
         - Don't mention you hope for specific answer
         - Randomize option order if possible
      ```

      ### Sample Size by Stage

      | Company Stage | Minimum | Recommended |
      |---------------|---------|-------------|
      | Early (< 100 users) | 20-30 | All eligible |
      | Growing (100-1000) | 50 | 100 |
      | Scaling (1000+) | 100 | 200+ |

      ### Interpreting Results

      ```
      Score = (Very Disappointed / Total) × 100%

      <25%: Clear problem
      25-40%: Getting closer
      40%+: PMF signal

      But also segment:
      - Is there 40%+ in any segment?
      - What differentiates high-scorers?
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Survey score volatile
      - Results don't match reality
      - Can't act on results
    detection_pattern: "PMF survey|sean ellis|very disappointed"

  - id: retention-misread
    summary: Misinterpreting retention curves
    severity: high
    situation: Wrong conclusions from retention data
    why: |
      Looking at wrong timeframe.
      Not cohorted properly.
      Not segmented.
    solution: |
      ## Correct Retention Analysis

      ### Cohort Analysis Setup

      ```
      Cohort = Users who started in same time period

      Week 0: 100 users sign up
      Week 1: 40 return (40%)
      Week 2: 30 return (30%)
      Week 4: 20 return (20%)
      Week 8: 18 return (18%)
      Week 12: 17 return (17%) ← Flattening

      Compare cohorts over time.
      ```

      ### What to Look For

      | Pattern | Meaning |
      |---------|---------|
      | Drops to zero | No PMF |
      | Flattens at low % | Niche PMF |
      | Flattens at high % | Strong PMF |
      | Improves over time | Product getting better |
      | Worsens over time | PMF degrading |

      ### Common Misreads

      | Misread | Reality |
      |---------|---------|
      | "70% left after month 1" | 30% retained may be great |
      | "Retention is 50%" | Is that Day 1 or Month 6? |
      | "We have good retention" | Compared to what benchmark? |

      ### Segment Retention

      ```
      Don't just look at blended:

      Segment A: 35% Month 3 retention
      Segment B: 8% Month 3 retention
      Blended: 20% (misleading)

      Focus on Segment A!
      ```

      ### Retention Benchmarks

      | Category | Good M1 | Good M3 | Good M6 |
      |----------|---------|---------|---------|
      | Consumer social | 25% | 15% | 10% |
      | Consumer utility | 35% | 25% | 20% |
      | B2B SaaS | 50% | 35% | 30% |
      | Enterprise | 70% | 60% | 55% |
    symptoms:
      - Conflicting conclusions about retention
      - "Good" retention but poor business outcomes
      - No cohort analysis
    detection_pattern: "retention|cohort|churn"

  - id: scaling-prematurely
    summary: Scaling growth before PMF confirmed
    severity: high
    situation: High CAC, poor retention, accelerating burn
    why: |
      Pressure to show growth.
      Assumption of PMF.
      Investors expect scaling.
    solution: |
      ## Pre-PMF vs Post-PMF Behavior

      ### Pre-PMF Rules

      ```
      DO:
      - Keep team small (≤10 people)
      - Conserve cash
      - Focus on retention, not acquisition
      - Talk to users constantly
      - Iterate quickly

      DON'T:
      - Hire aggressively
      - Spend on paid acquisition
      - Build for scale
      - Lock in long-term commitments
      ```

      ### PMF Confirmation Checklist

      Before scaling, confirm:
      - [ ] 40%+ "Very disappointed" (or equivalent)
      - [ ] Retention curve flattens at meaningful level
      - [ ] Can articulate why customers love it
      - [ ] Organic growth present
      - [ ] Repeat purchases / renewals healthy

      ### Scaling Readiness

      | Area | Pre-PMF | Post-PMF |
      |------|---------|----------|
      | Team | Founders + 5-10 | Start hiring |
      | Spend | Minimal marketing | Invest in acquisition |
      | Product | Rapid iteration | Stabilize and scale |
      | Process | Minimal | Build for scale |

      ### When Investors Push Scaling

      ```
      Response:
      "We're focused on retention metrics first.
       When we see [specific PMF signals],
       we'll be ready to scale efficiently.
       Scaling now would burn cash on leaky bucket."
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Burn rate increasing, retention poor
      - Growing team, shrinking efficiency
      - Investor pressure without metrics
    detection_pattern: "scaling|growth|team size|burn"

  - id: segment-blindness
    summary: Missing segment-specific PMF
    severity: medium
    situation: Giving up when overall PMF is weak
    why: |
      Looking only at aggregate data.
      Not segmenting users.
      Missing hidden success.
    solution: |
      ## Finding Hidden Segment PMF

      ### Segmentation Process

      ```
      1. Collect user attributes:
         - Company size
         - Industry
         - Role
         - Use case
         - Acquisition source
         - Feature usage

      2. Run PMF analysis per segment

      3. Find 40%+ pockets
      ```

      ### Segment Discovery

      | Attribute | How to Get |
      |-----------|------------|
      | Company size | Enrichment (Clearbit) |
      | Industry | Sign-up question or enrichment |
      | Role | Sign-up question |
      | Use case | Onboarding question |
      | Behavior | Product analytics |

      ### Acting on Segment PMF

      ```
      When you find 40%+ segment:

      1. Profile them deeply
      2. Understand why they love it
      3. Find more like them
      4. Build for them specifically
      5. Temporarily ignore low-PMF segments
      ```

      ### Common Hidden Segments

      | You Thought | Actually |
      |-------------|----------|
      | "All SMBs" | Agencies specifically |
      | "Developers" | Solo developers, not teams |
      | "E-commerce" | Shopify stores <$1M/year |

      Focus beats breadth at this stage.
    symptoms:
      - Overall PMF weak
      - Some users love it, most don't
      - Can't explain who product is for
    detection_pattern: "segment|target|ICP"

  - id: pmf-erosion-ignored
    summary: Not noticing PMF degradation
    severity: medium
    situation: Once-strong PMF weakening
    why: |
      Stopped measuring.
      Market changed.
      Product bloat.
    solution: |
      ## Monitoring PMF Health

      ### Early Warning Signals

      | Signal | Meaning |
      |--------|---------|
      | Retention declining by cohort | Product or market degrading |
      | PMF score dropping | Value perception declining |
      | NPS declining | Satisfaction erosion |
      | Churn increasing | Competitive pressure |
      | Organic growth slowing | Word-of-mouth weakening |

      ### Continuous Monitoring

      ```
      Monthly:
      - Retention by cohort
      - Churn analysis
      - NPS score

      Quarterly:
      - PMF survey
      - Customer interviews
      - Competitive analysis

      Alert Thresholds:
      - PMF score drops 5+ points
      - Retention drops 10%+ vs prior cohort
      - NPS drops 10+ points
      ```

      ### Causes of PMF Erosion

      | Cause | Detection | Response |
      |-------|-----------|----------|
      | Competition improved | Win rate dropping | Differentiate or improve |
      | Market changed | Customer needs shifting | Rediscover needs |
      | Product bloat | Complexity complaints | Simplify |
      | Core neglected | Basics breaking | Refocus |

      ### Recovery Protocol

      1. Acknowledge erosion
      2. Interview churned customers
      3. Interview remaining loyal customers
      4. Identify what changed
      5. Return to pre-PMF mindset
      6. Iterate rapidly again
    symptoms:
      - "We used to have such strong retention"
      - New competitors winning deals
      - Customers less enthusiastic
