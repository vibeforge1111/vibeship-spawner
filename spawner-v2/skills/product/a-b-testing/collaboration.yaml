# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Scientific Method
    insight: |
      Scientists know rigor:
      - Hypothesis before experiment
      - Sample size matters
      - Control groups essential
      - Null results are results
      A/B testing is applied science.
    applies_when: "Designing experiments"

  - domain: Statistics
    insight: |
      Statisticians know uncertainty:
      - P-values are thresholds
      - Confidence intervals matter
      - Power analysis prevents waste
      - Multiple comparisons inflate error
      Testing requires statistical rigor.
    applies_when: "Analyzing results"
