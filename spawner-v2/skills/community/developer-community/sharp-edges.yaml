      ## Balancing Enterprise and Community

      ### Dedicated Resources
      - Separate DevRel for community
      - Community roadmap input
      - Community-specific features
      - Don't deprioritize community bugs

      ### Transparency

      - Show community value to business
      - Celebrate community wins publicly

      ### Give Back
      - Enterprise funds OSS work
      - Community contributions benefit all
      - Open source non-differentiating code
      - Community advisory board
    symptoms:
      - "Only enterprise gets fixes"
      - Community features delayed
      - Less community engagement
      - Fork threats
    detection_pattern: "enterprise only|community ignored|paid features|fork"

      - Regular product sync
