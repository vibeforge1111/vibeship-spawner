    implementation: |
      ## Developer Community Flywheel

      ### The Cycle
      ```
      Great DX → Developers Build → They Share → More Developers → More Feedback → Better DX
      ```

      ### Phase 1: Foundation (DX Excellence)
      | Element | Standard | Why |
      |---------|----------|-----|
      | Time to Hello World | < 5 minutes | First impression |
      | Docs quality | Comprehensive + examples | Self-service |
      | Error messages | Helpful, not cryptic | Reduce frustration |
      | SDK quality | Idiomatic per language | Feel native |

      ### Phase 2: Enable Building
      - Starter templates
      - Example projects
      - Boilerplate generators
      - Integration guides

      ### Phase 3: Amplify Sharing
      - Showcase community projects
      - RT/share developer wins
      - Developer spotlight content
      - Conference talk support

      ### Phase 4: Gather Feedback
      - GitHub issues → product input
      - Discord/Slack for real-time
      - Developer surveys (quarterly)
      - Office hours

anti_patterns:
  - name: Marketing to Developers
    description: Treating developers like traditional marketing targets
    why_bad: |
      Developers detect and reject marketing.
      Trust is destroyed instantly.
      Word spreads in developer circles.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Help, don't sell.
      Show, don't tell.
      Ship useful things.
      Let the product speak.

  - name: Ignoring Contributor Friction
    description: Making it hard to contribute
    why_bad: |
      Potential contributors give up.
      Community stays small.
      Maintainer burnout.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Test contribution flow yourself.
      Fix pain points immediately.
      Thank every contributor.

  - name: Vanity DevRel Metrics
    description: Measuring followers instead of adoption
    why_bad: |
      Followers don't equal developers building.
      Can't tie to business value.
      Wrong incentives.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Measure: Time to first API call.
      Measure: Active integrations.
      Measure: Developer satisfaction (NPS).
      Measure: Community-driven bug fixes.
