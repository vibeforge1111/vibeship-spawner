      ### Channel Count Guidelines

      |-------------|--------------|------------|
      | < 500 | 10-15 | 3-4 |
      | 500-2K | 15-25 | 4-6 |

      ## Role Hierarchy

      ### Standard Roles (Top to Bottom)
      ```
      ADMIN (Full perms)
      ├── Lead Moderator
      ├── Senior Moderator
      ├── Moderator
      ├── Trial Moderator
      ├── VIP/OG
      ├── Active Member
      ├── Verified
      └── New Member
      ```

      ### Role Assignment
      | Role | How Earned | Perks |
      |------|------------|-------|
      | Verified | Complete onboarding | Basic access |
      | Active | Time + activity | More channels |
      | VIP | Contribution | Special access |
      | Mod | Application/invite | Mod tools |

      ### Permission Best Practices
      - Start restrictive, grant permissions up
      - Use role hierarchy properly
      - Avoid @everyone permissions
      - Regular permission audits

      - Document all bot settings
      - Regular bot audits

      ### Automod Setup

      | Raids | Lockdown | Mention spam |
      | Scams | Delete + ban | Crypto scams |
