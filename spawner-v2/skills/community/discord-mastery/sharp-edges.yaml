      ## Raid Prevention & Response

      ### Prevention
      - Enable verification level (Medium+)
      - Use verification bot/captcha
      - Limit new member permissions
      - Hide sensitive channels from new members

      ### Detection
      - Unusual join spike
      - New accounts posting immediately
      - Same/similar messages
      - Mention spam

      ### Response Protocol
      1. IMMEDIATE: Enable slowmode (all channels)
      2. IF SEVERE: Lock server (disable join)
      3. Ban raid accounts
      4. Review logs for patterns
      5. Report to Discord Trust & Safety

      ### Automod Settings for Raids
      ```
      - Block mass mentions (5+ in message)
      - Block new account spam (< 1 day old)
      - Enable anti-raid mode in modbot
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Spam flood
      - Mass joins
      - Chaos in channels

  - id: permission-creep
    summary: Permissions granted carelessly over time
    severity: medium
    situation: Too many people with too many permissions
    why: |
      Giving perms to fix quick issues.
      Not revoking when roles change.
      No regular audits.
    solution: |
      ## Permission Hygiene

      ### Audit Checklist
      - [ ] Who has admin? (Should be 2-3 max)
      - [ ] Who can ban? (Mods only)
      - [ ] Who can manage channels? (Leads only)
      - [ ] Who can @everyone? (Admins only)

      ### Cleanup Process
      1. Export current role/perm list
      2. Review each elevated role
      3. Remove unnecessary permissions
      4. Document who has what and why

      ### Prevention
      - Grant minimum necessary
      - Document permission grants
      - Quarterly permission audits
      - Revoke on role change
    symptoms:
      - "Who gave them perms?"
      - Accidental @everyone
      - Unauthorized changes
      - Security concerns

  - id: dead-channel-syndrome
    summary: Many channels with no activity
    severity: medium
    situation: Server looks abandoned with empty channels

      ## Channel Health

      ### Activity Audit
      | Last Message | Action |
      |--------------|--------|
      | < 7 days | Healthy |
      | 7-30 days | Monitor |
      | 30-90 days | Consider archiving |
      | > 90 days | Archive or delete |

      ### Archive Process
      1. Create "Archive" category (hidden from most)
      2. Move dead channels there
      3. Or export and delete
      4. Announce consolidation

      ### Prevention
      - Start with fewer channels
      - Earn channels through demand
      - Use threads for temp topics
      - Regular channel reviews
    symptoms:
      - Empty channels
      - "Where is everyone?"
      - Activity in 2-3 channels only
      - New members confused
