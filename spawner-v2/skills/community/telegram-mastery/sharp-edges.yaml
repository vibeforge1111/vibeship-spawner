      | Anti-spam | Delete messages, ban users |
      | Welcome | Post messages |
      | Analytics | Read messages only |

      ### Recovery Plan
      - Multiple human admins (not just bot)
      - Know how to remove bot quickly
      - Backup admin on standby
      - Regular permission audits
    symptoms:
      - Bot misbehaving
      - Unexpected bans
      - Spam from bot
      - Group settings changed

      | Group Size | Activity | Slow Mode |
      |------------|----------|-----------|
      | < 1K | Low | None |
      | < 1K | High | 30s |
      | 1K-10K | Normal | 30s-1min |
      | 1K-10K | Busy | 1-5min |
      | 10K+ | Normal | 1-5min |
      | Any | During raid | Max |

      ### Dynamic Adjustment

      - Decrease during quiet times
      - Temporary increase for events
      - Communicate changes

      ### Alternatives to Slow Mode

      - Announcement channel (low volume)
