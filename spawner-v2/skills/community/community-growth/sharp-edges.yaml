sharp_edges:
  - id: growth-over-health
    summary: Prioritizing growth metrics over community health
    severity: high
    situation: Pushing for member count while engagement declines
    why: |
      Leadership wants big numbers.
      Easy to measure growth.
      Health metrics harder to track.
    solution: |
      ## Balancing Growth and Health

      ### Health-First Metrics
      | Track This | Not Just This |
      |------------|---------------|
      | DAU/MAU ratio | Total members |
      | Messages per member | Total messages |
      | Retention rate | New joins |
      | NPS/satisfaction | Page views |

      ### Growth Gates
      Only scale when:
      - 40%+ DAU/MAU ratio
      - 50%+ week-1 retention
      - Positive member sentiment
      - Ops can handle volume

      ### Healthy Growth Rate
      - 10-20% monthly is sustainable
      - 50%+ monthly risks culture dilution
      - Quality always beats quantity
    symptoms:
      - Big numbers, low engagement
      - "Ghost town" feeling
      - OG members leaving
      - Culture complaints
    detection_pattern: "growing but|numbers up|engagement down|quiet"

  - id: event-fatigue
    summary: Members tired of constant events
    severity: medium
    situation: Event attendance declining despite more events
    why: |
      Team thinks more events = more engagement.
      No event strategy, just calendar filling.
      Same formats, no innovation.
    solution: |
      ## Preventing Event Fatigue

      ### Event Audit
      | Question | Action |
      |----------|--------|
      | < 20% of expected attendance? | Cut or redesign |
      | Declining over time? | Evaluate format |
      | No buzz after? | Wrong content |
      | Team exhausted? | Reduce frequency |

      ### Quality Over Quantity
      - Max 2-3 events per month
      - Each event has clear purpose
      - Build anticipation (not routine)
      - Rotate formats

      ### Event ROI
      - Track attendance trends
      - Post-event engagement
      - Member feedback
      - Team effort vs. impact
    symptoms:
      - Declining attendance
      - "Another event?"
      - Team burnout
      - Low post-event engagement
    detection_pattern: "too many events|event fatigue|nobody showed|burnout"

  - id: referral-spam
    summary: Incentivized referrals attracting low-quality members
    severity: medium
    situation: Referral program brings volume but wrong people
    why: |
      Rewards too generous.
      No quality filter.
      Incentivizing wrong behavior.
    solution: |
      ## Quality Referral Design

      ### Anti-Gaming Measures
      - Reward after referred member is active (not just joined)
      - Cap referrals per person
      - Quality threshold (X messages, Y days active)
      - Manual review for top referrers

      ### Right Incentives
      | Bad | Good |
      |-----|------|
      | Cash per referral | Recognition and access |
      | Unlimited rewards | Tiered, capped benefits |
      | Instant payout | Delayed after activation |

      ### Referral Quality Tracking
      - Referral vs organic retention
      - Activity of referred members
      - Source quality scoring
    symptoms:
      - Spam invites
      - Referred members inactive
      - Gaming the system
      - Quality decline
    detection_pattern: "referral spam|gaming|low quality|inactive referrals"

  - id: content-vacuum
    summary: Community has no content or all content from team
    severity: medium
    situation: Members consume but don't create
    why: |
      No prompts or encouragement.
      Too high barrier to post.
      Fear of judgment.
      Team dominates conversation.
    solution: |
      ## Encouraging Member Content

      ### Lower the Bar
      - Simple prompts (yes/no, this or that)
      - Templates and frameworks
      - Celebrate all contributions
      - Private sharing options first

      ### Content Prompts
      - "What are you working on?"
      - "Share a win from this week"
      - "What's one thing you learned?"
      - "Show us your setup"

      ### Recognition
      - Feature member content
      - Member spotlight series
      - React to all posts
      - Thank contributors publicly
    symptoms:
      - Only team posting
      - Questions go unanswered by members
      - Low original content
      - Consumption-only behavior
    detection_pattern: "no one posts|only team|lurkers|quiet"
