# Community Analytics Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: vanity-metrics-trap
    summary: Optimizing for wrong metrics
    severity: high
    situation: Growing member count while health declines
    why: |
      Easy metrics are often wrong metrics.
      Leadership asks for simple numbers.
      Growth is visible, health is not.
    solution: |
      ## Avoiding Vanity Metrics

      ### Vanity vs Value
      | Vanity | Value |
      |--------|-------|
      | Total members | Active members |
      | Total messages | Conversations |
      | Page views | Time engaged |
      | Followers | Engagement rate |

      ### Reporting Balance
      Always pair growth with health:
      - "500 new members, 45% week-1 retention"
      - "10K messages, 3.2 avg thread depth"
      - "20K followers, 5% engagement rate"

      ### Executive Dashboard
      - Lead with health, not just growth
      - Show trends, not just snapshots
      - Include qualitative alongside quantitative
    symptoms:
      - Big numbers, declining engagement
      - Leadership happy, team worried
      - Can't explain business value
    detection_pattern: "numbers look good|but engagement|vanity|meaningless"

  - id: data-paralysis
    summary: Too much data, no decisions
    severity: medium
    situation: Drowning in dashboards but not acting
    why: |
      Collecting everything possible.
      No clear questions driving analysis.
      Fear of missing something.
    solution: |
      ## From Data to Decision

      ### Question-First Analytics
      1. What decision are we making?
      2. What data would inform it?
      3. Collect only that data
      4. Make the decision

      ### Metrics Hierarchy
      - North Star: 1 metric (health score)
      - Primary: 3-5 metrics (activity, retention, sentiment)
      - Secondary: 10-15 supporting metrics
      - Diagnostic: As needed for investigation

      ### Regular Pruning
      - Quarterly: What metrics did we not use?
      - Delete unused dashboards
      - Simplify reports
    symptoms:
      - 20+ dashboards
      - Reports nobody reads
      - "What should we look at?"
      - No action from data
    detection_pattern: "too much data|which dashboard|not sure what|overwhelming"

  - id: sentiment-blind
    summary: Ignoring qualitative sentiment
    severity: medium
    situation: Metrics look good but members unhappy
    why: |
      Quantitative is easier to track.
      Sentiment requires interpretation.
      Numbers feel more objective.
    solution: |
      ## Capturing Sentiment

      ### Sentiment Sources
      | Source | Frequency | Method |
      |--------|-----------|--------|
      | NPS survey | Quarterly | Scale 1-10 |
      | Pulse checks | Monthly | Quick emoji vote |
      | Exit interviews | On churn | 1:1 or form |
      | Message analysis | Continuous | AI sentiment |

      ### Warning Signs
      - Negative tone increasing
      - Complaints in messages
      - Less enthusiasm over time
      - "It's not like it used to be"

      ### Integrating Sentiment
      - Include in health score
      - Qualitative in reports
      - Regular member conversations
    symptoms:
      - Surprise churn
      - "Everything seemed fine"
      - Negative feedback blindsides
      - Community feels off
    detection_pattern: "didn't see it coming|seemed fine|surprised|off vibe"
