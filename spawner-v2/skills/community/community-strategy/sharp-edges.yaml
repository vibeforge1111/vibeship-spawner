# Community Strategy Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: community-without-audience
    summary: Building community before having any audience
    severity: high
    situation: Launching a community platform with zero existing followers
    why: |
      No seed members means no initial activity.
      Empty channels feel dead and repel visitors.
      Catch-22: people join active communities, but need people to be active.
    solution: |
      ## Build Audience First

      ### The Sequence
      ```
      1. Build audience (newsletter, Twitter, content)
      2. Identify most engaged members
      3. Invite them to private community
      4. Get to 50-100 active members
      5. THEN open to public
      ```

      ### Seed Member Criteria
      - Already engaging with your content
      - Will show up and participate
      - Aligned with community values
      - Mix of personalities (not all lurkers)

      ### Minimum Viable Activity
      | Before Launch | Target |
      |---------------|--------|
      | Committed seed members | 50-100 |
      | Daily active posters | 10+ |
      | Content in channels | 3 days worth |
      | Welcome messages ready | Yes |
    symptoms:
      - Ghost town community
      - Only founders posting
      - New members leave immediately
      - "Is anyone here?" messages
    detection_pattern: "empty community|no activity|ghost town|dead server"

  - id: community-strategy-mismatch
    summary: Community strategy doesn't match business model
    severity: high
    situation: Community goals conflict with how the business makes money
    why: |
      If community success hurts revenue, it will be deprioritized.
      Misaligned incentives create tension.
      Community team fights uphill battle.
    solution: |
      ## Aligning Community with Business

      ### Alignment Canvas
      | Business Goal | Community Contribution |
      |---------------|----------------------|
      | Reduce churn | Members help each other |
      | Reduce support costs | Peer-to-peer support |
      | Increase referrals | Advocates bring friends |
      | Product feedback | Direct user insights |
      | Brand awareness | Member-generated content |

      ### Red Flags of Misalignment
      - Community budget is first to be cut
      - No exec sponsor for community
      - Community metrics not in company OKRs
      - Community seen as "nice to have"

      ### Fix Strategies
      1. Tie community metrics to business metrics
      2. Get executive sponsor
      3. Report on $ impact, not just engagement
      4. Make community essential to product experience
    symptoms:
      - Community budget cut
      - No executive support
      - Team of one, overwhelmed
      - Community is afterthought
    detection_pattern: "budget cut|no support|deprioritized|why do we have community"

  - id: culture-drift
    summary: Community culture drifts from original values
    severity: medium
    situation: As community grows, original culture gets diluted or changes
    why: |
      New members outnumber old members.
      Values weren't documented or reinforced.
      Growth prioritized over culture fit.
    solution: |
      ## Preventing Culture Drift

      ### Documentation
      - Write down values explicitly
      - Document "what we do" and "what we don't do"
      - Create onboarding that teaches culture
      - Tell origin stories regularly

      ### Reinforcement
      | Mechanism | Frequency |
      |-----------|-----------|
      | Value-aligned recognition | Daily |
      | Calling out anti-norms | As needed |
      | Culture-focused AMAs | Monthly |
      | Values retrospective | Quarterly |

      ### Scaling Culture
      - Train moderators as culture carriers
      - Create ambassador program for values
      - New member mentorship program
      - Sub-community culture alignment checks
    symptoms:
      - "This place has changed"
      - OG members leaving
      - Toxicity increasing
      - Values feel hollow
    detection_pattern: "community changed|not like before|lost its soul|toxic"

  - id: governance-vacuum
    summary: No clear decision-making process as community scales
    severity: medium
    situation: Community outgrows founder-led governance but nothing replaces it
    why: |
      Founder can't personally handle everything.
      Decisions stall or become inconsistent.
      Members frustrated by lack of clarity.
    solution: |
      ## Governance Transition

      ### Signs You Need More Structure
      - Same questions asked repeatedly
      - Decisions taking too long
      - Inconsistent rule enforcement
      - Members unsure who to ask

      ### Transition Steps
      1. Document current implicit rules
      2. Create mod team with clear authority
      3. Establish escalation paths
      4. Set up regular governance reviews
      5. Create transparency mechanisms

      ### Governance Artifacts
      - Community guidelines (public)
      - Mod handbook (internal)
      - Decision log (transparency)
      - Appeals process (fairness)
    symptoms:
      - "Who decides this?"
      - Inconsistent enforcement
      - Founder bottleneck
      - Member frustration
    detection_pattern: "who decides|unfair|inconsistent|no process"

  - id: vanity-metrics-trap
    summary: Optimizing for wrong metrics
    severity: medium
    situation: Chasing member count instead of community health
    why: |
      Easy to measure doesn't mean important.
      Growth can mask declining health.
      Wrong metrics drive wrong behavior.
    solution: |
      ## Right Metrics Framework

      ### Vanity vs. Value Metrics
      | Vanity (Avoid) | Value (Track) |
      |----------------|---------------|
      | Total members | Active members (DAU/MAU) |
      | Messages sent | Conversations (threads) |
      | Page views | Time to first value |
      | Followers | Referral rate |
      | Likes | Help requests resolved |

      ### Health Indicators
      - Retention: Do members come back?
      - Depth: Are connections forming?
      - Contribution: Is value being created?
      - Sentiment: Do members feel good?
      - Referral: Do members invite others?

      ### Reporting Structure
      1. Weekly: Activity metrics
      2. Monthly: Health metrics
      3. Quarterly: Outcome metrics
      4. Annually: Strategic metrics
    symptoms:
      - Big numbers, low engagement
      - Growth but declining activity
      - Can't prove business value
      - Leadership skeptical
    detection_pattern: "numbers look good but|not engaged|low retention|vanity"
