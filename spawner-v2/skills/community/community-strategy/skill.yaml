    sustainable communities create value for everyone involved.

    when_to_use: Before starting any community initiative
    implementation: |
      ## Community-Market Fit Canvas

      ### 1. Member Definition
      | Question | Answer |
      |----------|--------|
      | Who are they? | [Specific persona] |
      | What do they struggle with? | [Pain points] |
      | Where do they currently gather? | [Existing communities] |
      | Why would they leave/add yours? | [Unique value] |

      ### 2. Value Proposition
      | For Members | For Business |
      |-------------|--------------|
      | Connection to peers | Customer insights |
      | Access to knowledge | Reduced support costs |
      | Career opportunities | Brand advocacy |
      | Recognition/status | Product feedback loop |

      ### 3. Validation Signals
      - 10 people actively asking for this
      - Existing fragmented communities
      - Clear pain point your community solves
      - Members willing to contribute, not just consume

      ### 4. Red Flags (Don't Build)
      - "We should have a community" without clear why
      - No existing audience to seed from
      - Purely extractive business goals
      - No budget for community team

  - name: Culture Architecture
    description: Designing intentional community culture
    when_to_use: When establishing or reshaping community identity
    implementation: |
      ## Culture Design Framework

      ### Core Elements

      **1. Values (What We Believe)**
      - 3-5 core values, specific not generic
      - Bad: "We value respect" (everyone says this)
      - Good: "We celebrate failed experiments publicly"

      **2. Norms (How We Behave)**
      | Value | Norm | Anti-Norm |
      |-------|------|-----------|
      | Radical honesty | Share failures openly | Humble-bragging |
      | Builder mindset | Show work-in-progress | Only polished content |
      | Generosity | Answer before asking | Lurking indefinitely |

      **3. Rituals (What We Do Together)**
      - Daily: GM threads, standup posts
      - Weekly: Office hours, wins celebration
      - Monthly: AMAs, retrospectives
      - Annually: Community awards, meetups

      **4. Symbols (What Identifies Us)**
      - Language/slang unique to community
      - Visual identity and memes
      - Credentials and roles
      - Origin story and lore

  - name: Member Journey Mapping
    description: Designing the path from stranger to advocate
    when_to_use: When optimizing member experience
    implementation: |
      ## Member Journey Stages

      ```
      STRANGER → VISITOR → MEMBER → CONTRIBUTOR → ADVOCATE → LEADER
      ```

      ### Stage Definitions

      | Stage | Behavior | Goal | Metric |
      |-------|----------|------|--------|
      | Stranger | Unaware of community | Awareness | Reach |
      | Visitor | Lurking, reading | First value | Time to first value |
      | Member | Introduced self, engaged once | Regular participation | DAU/MAU |
      | Contributor | Creates content, helps others | Consistent contribution | Posts/week |
      | Advocate | Invites others, defends community | Referrals | Invite rate |
      | Leader | Moderates, leads initiatives | Ownership | Programs led |

      ### Transition Triggers

      | Transition | Trigger |
      |------------|---------|
      | Stranger → Visitor | Content discovery, referral |
      | Visitor → Member | Welcome flow, first reply received |
      | Member → Contributor | Recognition, asked for help |
      | Contributor → Advocate | Exclusive access, deeper relationships |
      | Advocate → Leader | Formal role, training program |

  - name: Governance Evolution
    description: Governance models for different community stages
    when_to_use: When structuring decision-making
    implementation: |
      ## Governance By Stage

      ### Stage 1: Founder-Led (0-100 members)
      - Founder makes all decisions
      - Direct relationships with most members
      - Culture set by example
      - Fast, informal, personal

      ### Stage 2: Core Team (100-1K members)
      - Small trusted team helps govern
      - Written guidelines emerge
      - Mod team established
      - Regular community input sessions

      ### Stage 3: Representative (1K-10K members)
      - Community councils or guilds
      - Formal feedback mechanisms
      - Elected/appointed representatives
      - Transparent decision logging

      ### Stage 4: Distributed (10K+ members)
      - Sub-communities with autonomy
      - Governance frameworks documented
      - Appeals and escalation paths
      - Potential token/voting systems

      ### Governance Principles
      1. Start simple, add complexity only when needed
      2. Document decisions, not just rules
      3. Make the implicit explicit
      4. Create paths for members to gain governance power

anti_patterns:
  - name: Build It And They Will Come
    description: Launching community without existing audience
    why_bad: |
      Empty communities feel dead and repel new members.
      No seed audience means no initial activity.
      Chicken-and-egg problem is very hard to solve.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Build audience first (newsletter, Twitter, etc.).
      Start with 50-100 committed seed members.
      Create activity before opening doors widely.

  - name: Copy-Paste Culture
    description: Adopting another community's culture wholesale
    why_bad: |
      Culture must be authentic to your context.
      What works for one community may poison another.
      Members detect inauthenticity quickly.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Study other cultures, but design your own.
      Involve early members in culture definition.
      Let culture emerge from genuine interactions.

  - name: Metrics Over Meaning
    description: Optimizing for numbers instead of value
    why_bad: |
      Vanity metrics don't reflect community health.
      Growth hacking tactics attract wrong members.
      Short-term gains, long-term culture damage.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Focus on depth before breadth.
      Measure outcomes that matter to members.
      Prioritize quality of connections over quantity.

  - name: Democracy From Day One
    description: Giving governance power before community is ready
    why_bad: |
      New communities need direction and speed.
      Premature democracy leads to bikeshedding.
      Members don't have context to make good decisions.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Start with benevolent dictatorship.
      Evolve governance as community matures.
      Earn trust before distributing power.
