      ## Moderation System Design

      ### Moderation Tiers
      | Level | Action | Who | Response Time |
      |-------|--------|-----|---------------|
      | 1 | Spam, obvious violations | Automod/bots | Instant |
      | 2 | Minor violations | Junior mods | < 1 hour |
      | 3 | Serious violations | Senior mods | < 4 hours |
      | 4 | Bans, legal issues | Lead/Admin | < 24 hours |

      ### Escalation Path
      ```
      Automod → Junior Mod → Senior Mod → Lead → Admin → Legal
      ```

      ### Moderation Actions
      | Severity | First Offense | Second | Third |
      |----------|---------------|--------|-------|
      | Minor | Warning | 24h mute | 7d mute |
      | Moderate | 24h mute | 7d ban | Permanent |
      | Severe | 7d ban | Permanent | Report to platform |
      | Critical | Immediate ban | N/A | N/A |

      ### Documentation Required
      - Screenshot of violation
      - Rule violated
      - Action taken
      - Mod who took action
      - Appeals process communicated

    implementation: |
      ## Member Onboarding

      ### The First 5 Minutes
      ```
      JOIN → WELCOME → RULES → INTRO → FIRST VALUE → FIRST CONNECTION
      ```

      ### Onboarding Checklist
      - [ ] Automated welcome message (immediate)
      - [ ] Rules acknowledgment (before access)

      1. Introduce yourself in #introductions
      2. Check out #start-here for orientation
      3. Ask questions in #help

      Our values: [brief values]

      | 2 | Harassment report | Senior mod, documentation |
      | 3 | Coordinated attack | All hands, lockdown option |
      | 4 | Legal/safety threat | Leadership, legal, platform |

      ### Immediate Actions (First 15 Minutes)
      1. Assess severity level
      2. Document everything (screenshots)
      3. Contain if possible (mute, slow mode)
      4. Alert appropriate team members
      5. Do NOT engage emotionally

      ### Communication Template
      ```
      Team - we have a Level [X] situation:

      What happened: [brief factual summary]
      Current status: [contained/ongoing]
      Immediate needs: [what help needed]
      Next steps: [planned actions]

      Thread for updates: [link]
      ```

      ## Scaling Framework

      ### Team Structure by Size
      | Community Size | Team Structure |
      |----------------|----------------|
      | 0-500 | 1 community manager |
      | 500-2K | CM + 2-3 volunteer mods |
      | 2K-10K | CM + mod lead + 5-10 mods |
      | 10K-50K | Community team + regional mods |
      | 50K+ | Full community org |

      ### Automation Priorities
      | Automate First | Keep Human |
      |----------------|------------|
      | Spam filtering | Appeals |
      | Welcome messages | Introductions |
      | FAQ responses | Complex questions |
      | Role assignment | Culture enforcement |
      | Metrics collection | Relationship building |

      ### Mod Team Management
      - Clear roles and responsibilities
      - Regular syncs (weekly minimum)
      - Recognition and appreciation
      - Burnout monitoring
      - Growth paths (mod → senior → lead)

anti_patterns:
  - name: Mod Burnout Factory
    description: Overworking volunteer moderators
    why_bad: |
      Volunteers have limits. Burned out mods quit or become toxic.
      No recognition leads to resentment. Inconsistent coverage hurts community.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Set clear shift expectations. Rotate responsibilities.
      Recognize contributions publicly. Check in on mental health.
      Build mod team, not mod heroes.

  - name: Rule Lawyer Moderation
    description: Applying rules without context or empathy
    why_bad: |
      Communities are human, not courtrooms.
      Technically correct but emotionally wrong damages trust.
      Members feel policed, not supported.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Train mods on intent behind rules. Empower judgment calls.
      Default to empathy, escalate edge cases.
      Focus on outcomes, not just rules.

  - name: Invisible Until Crisis
    description: Mods only visible when enforcing rules
    why_bad: |
      Members see mods as police, not community members.
      No relationship built before conflict.
      Enforcement feels punitive, not protective.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Mods participate as regular members too.
      Positive interactions outnumber enforcement.
      Build relationships before needing to moderate.
