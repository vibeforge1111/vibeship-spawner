anti_patterns:
  - name: Broadcast-Only Social
    description: Using social to broadcast, not engage
    why_bad: |
      No community forms from one-way content.
      Followers don't become members.
      Algorithm penalizes low engagement.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      80% engagement, 20% broadcast.
      Reply, quote, comment.
      Build relationships, not just reach.

  - name: Platform Mismatch
    description: Same content across all platforms
    why_bad: |
      Each platform has different culture.
      Content that works on Twitter fails on Reddit.
      Feels inauthentic.
    what_to_do_instead: |
      Adapt to platform culture.
      Different content types per platform.
      Native feel on each.
