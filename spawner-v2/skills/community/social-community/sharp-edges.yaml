      ## Handling Ratio/Backlash

      ### Prevention
      - Multiple eyes on sensitive content
      - Read recent discourse before posting
      - Avoid hot-take culture
      - Test with community members first

      ### Response
      1. Don't delete immediately (looks worse)
      2. Assess if genuine mistake
      3. If wrong: Acknowledge, apologize, learn
      4. If misunderstood: Clarify calmly
      5. Don't argue with pile-on

      ### Recovery
      - Let it blow over (24-48h)

      - Address privately if needed
      - Document for future learning

  - id: cross-platform-fatigue
    summary: Team stretched thin across too many platforms
    severity: medium
    situation: Quality drops trying to be everywhere
    why: |
      FOMO on platforms.
      No prioritization.
      Same team doing everything.
    solution: |
      ## Platform Prioritization

      ### Assessment
      | Platform | Audience There? | ROI? | Resource Cost? |
      |----------|-----------------|------|----------------|
      | Twitter | Score 1-5 | Score 1-5 | Score 1-5 |
      | Reddit | Score 1-5 | Score 1-5 | Score 1-5 |
      | etc. | ... | ... | ... |

      ### Prioritization
      - Tier 1: Active, engaged (2-3 platforms max)
      - Tier 2: Presence, low effort
      - Tier 3: Not yet, future consideration

      ### Resource Allocation
      - 70% to Tier 1 platforms
      - 20% to Tier 2
      - 10% experimentation

      ### When to Cut
      - Low engagement after 3 months
      - Team burnout
      - Better ROI elsewhere
    symptoms:
      - Inconsistent posting
      - Team overwhelmed
      - Quality declining
      - "We should be on X too"
    detection_pattern: "too many|stretched thin|can't keep up|overwhelmed"
