# Community Tooling Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: tool-vendor-lock
    summary: Locked into tool that no longer fits
    severity: medium
    situation: Can't switch tools because data is trapped
    why: |
      No export capability.
      Workflows built around tool.
      Team too invested to switch.
      Historical data would be lost.
    solution: |
      ## Avoiding Vendor Lock-in

      ### Prevention
      - Evaluate export capabilities before adopting
      - Keep data in portable formats
      - Document workflows independently
      - Regular export backups
      - Negotiate data portability in contracts

      ### Mitigation
      | Scenario | Approach |
      |----------|----------|
      | API available | Build export scripts |
      | Limited export | Manual documentation |
      | No export | Screenshot/record key data |

      ### Switching Checklist
      - [ ] Export all member data
      - [ ] Document current workflows
      - [ ] Parallel run period
      - [ ] Communicate to community
      - [ ] Archive old platform access
    symptoms:
      - "We can't leave because..."
      - Tool pricing increases
      - Features removed
      - Better options available but stuck

  - id: bot-compromise
    summary: Discord bot token compromised
    severity: critical
    situation: Malicious actor gains control of bot
    why: |
      Token exposed in code.
      Shared with wrong person.
      Compromised team member.
    solution: |
      ## Bot Security

      ### Prevention
      - Never commit tokens to git
      - Use environment variables
      - Rotate tokens regularly
      - Limit who has access
      - Minimum required permissions

      ### If Compromised
      1. Immediately regenerate token in Discord
      2. Kick bot from server temporarily
      3. Audit what happened
      4. Check for damage
      5. Re-add with new token
      6. Inform community if needed

      ### Token Security Checklist
      - [ ] Token in env vars, not code
      - [ ] .gitignore includes .env
      - [ ] Limited team access
      - [ ] Rotation schedule
      - [ ] Audit log monitoring
    symptoms:
      - Bot sending strange messages
      - Bot mass-DMing members
      - Bot deleting channels
      - Unknown bot actions
    detection_pattern: "bot hacked|compromised|strange messages|bot went crazy"

  - id: analytics-paralysis
    summary: Too much data, no actionable insights
    severity: medium
    situation: Dashboard overload, no clear actions
    why: |
      Tracking everything possible.
      No focus on what matters.
      Data without context.
    solution: |
      ## Analytics Focus

      ### Hierarchy of Metrics
      | Level | Focus | Action Frequency |
      |-------|-------|------------------|
      | North Star | 1 metric | Quarterly review |
      | Primary | 3-5 metrics | Monthly review |
      | Secondary | 5-10 metrics | Weekly review |
      | Diagnostic | As needed | When investigating |

      ### From Data to Action
      1. Define the question first
      2. Find relevant metric
      3. Set baseline
      4. Monitor change
      5. Correlate with actions

      ### Dashboard Design
      - One-page summary
      - Clear trends (not just numbers)
      - Compared to goals
      - Actionable insights highlighted
      - Easy drill-down
    symptoms:
      - Multiple dashboards
      - "We track everything"
      - No one looks at dashboards
      - Can't answer basic questions
    detection_pattern: "too much data|analysis paralysis|don't know what to look at"

  - id: automation-brittleness
    summary: Automated workflows break silently
    severity: medium
    situation: Automation stops working, no one notices
    why: |
      No monitoring.
      Platform changes break integration.
      API changes.
      Token expiration.
    solution: |
      ## Robust Automation

      ### Monitoring
      - Error notifications
      - Regular test runs
      - Success logging
      - Human-in-loop for critical flows

      ### Design Principles
      - Fail loudly, not silently
      - Idempotent where possible
      - Retry with backoff
      - Fallback procedures
      - Document manual alternative

      ### Maintenance Schedule
      | Frequency | Check |
      |-----------|-------|
      | Daily | Critical flows running |
      | Weekly | Review error logs |
      | Monthly | Test all automations |
      | Quarterly | Full audit |
    symptoms:
      - "That automation hasn't run in weeks"
      - Members not getting onboarded
      - Notifications not sending
      - Data not syncing
    detection_pattern: "broken|stopped working|not running|haven't received"
