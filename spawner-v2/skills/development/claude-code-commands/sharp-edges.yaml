# Claude Code Commands Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: command-location-priority
    summary: Commands in wrong location aren't discovered
    severity: high
    situation: Created command but /command doesn't appear
    why: |
      Claude Code looks in specific locations with priority order.
      Project commands in .claude/commands/ (team-shared).
      Personal commands in ~/.claude/commands/ (user-only).
      Wrong location means command not found.
    solution: |
      // Command location hierarchy and discovery

      // Project commands (checked into git, shared with team)
      .claude/commands/
      ├── feature.md      # /feature
      ├── review.md       # /review
      └── deploy.md       # /deploy

      // Personal commands (not in git, user-specific)
      ~/.claude/commands/
      ├── my-workflow.md  # /my-workflow
      └── scratch.md      # /scratch

      // Priority order:
      // 1. .claude/commands/ (project)
      // 2. ~/.claude/commands/ (personal)

      // If same name exists in both, project wins

      // Verify command is discovered:
      // Type / in Claude Code to see available commands
      // Commands appear in the autocomplete menu

      // Common mistakes:
      // WRONG: commands/.claude/feature.md
      // WRONG: .claude/command/feature.md (singular)
      // WRONG: claude/commands/feature.md (no dot)

      // CORRECT: .claude/commands/feature.md
    symptoms:
      - Command not appearing in / menu
      - "Unknown command" error
      - Works for you but not teammates
    detection_pattern: 'commands/\\.|command/|claude/commands[^/]'

  - id: arguments-not-substituting
    summary: $ARGUMENTS appears literally instead of being replaced
    severity: high
    situation: Command shows $ARGUMENTS instead of user's input
    why: |
      $ARGUMENTS must be exact - case sensitive, with dollar sign.
      Common typos prevent substitution.
      No error message when substitution fails.
    solution: |
      // Correct $ARGUMENTS usage

      // CORRECT
      # Feature: $ARGUMENTS
      You will implement a feature: $ARGUMENTS

      // WRONG - won't substitute
      # Feature: $Arguments         # Wrong case
      # Feature: $ARGUMENT          # Missing S
      # Feature: ${ARGUMENTS}       # Wrong syntax
      # Feature: $arguments         # Wrong case
      # Feature: ARGUMENTS          # Missing $

      // Multiple uses work:
      The feature "$ARGUMENTS" will be implemented.
      First, research $ARGUMENTS in the codebase.
      Create branch feature/$ARGUMENTS.

      // Usage examples in command:
      ---
      # Usage: /feature add user avatars
      # $ARGUMENTS becomes: "add user avatars"

      // Handling optional arguments:
      # Command with optional argument

      ## Input
      Feature request: $ARGUMENTS

      If no arguments provided, ask the user what feature
      they want to implement.

      // Parsing complex arguments:
      # DB Command: $ARGUMENTS

      Parse $ARGUMENTS as follows:
      - First word: operation (migrate, seed, query)
      - Rest: parameters for that operation

      Example: "query SELECT * FROM users"
      - Operation: query
      - Parameters: SELECT * FROM users
    symptoms:
      - Literal $ARGUMENTS in output
      - Claude asks for feature name after invocation
      - Substitution works sometimes but not others
    detection_pattern: '\$[Aa]rguments|\$ARGUMENT[^S]|\$\{ARGUMENTS\}'

  - id: file-reference-not-loading
    summary: @file reference doesn't include file contents
    severity: medium
    situation: File reference treated as literal text
    why: |
      @file syntax only works in certain positions.
      File path must be relative to project root.
      File must exist at that path.
    solution: |
      // @file reference patterns

      // CORRECT - on its own line
      @src/architecture.md

      // CORRECT - after section header
      ## Guidelines
      @docs/style-guide.md

      // MIGHT NOT WORK - inline
      Follow the rules in @src/rules.md and continue.

      // CORRECT - multiple files
      ## Reference Files
      @src/types.ts
      @src/config.ts
      @src/utils.ts

      // Path resolution:
      // Paths are relative to project root
      // NOT relative to the command file

      // Example structure:
      project/
      ├── .claude/commands/review.md    # Command file
      ├── src/architecture.md           # @src/architecture.md
      └── docs/style.md                 # @docs/style.md

      // In review.md:
      ## Architecture
      @src/architecture.md

      # NOT: @../src/architecture.md

      // Verify file exists:
      // If file doesn't exist, reference is ignored silently

      // Alternative: explicit read instruction
      ## Guidelines
      First, read the file at src/architecture.md and follow
      its patterns in this review.
    symptoms:
      - File contents not appearing in context
      - "@filename" treated as literal text
      - Works in some commands but not others
    detection_pattern: '@\\./|@\\.\\./'

  - id: command-markdown-rendering
    summary: Markdown in commands renders unexpectedly
    severity: medium
    situation: Command formatting breaks or behaves oddly
    why: |
      Commands are markdown files.
      Code blocks, headers, and formatting are interpreted.
      Some markdown affects how Claude processes the command.
    solution: |
      // Markdown in commands - what matters

      // HEADERS - structure the command
      # Main Title (usually command name)
      ## Sections (workflow steps)
      ### Subsections (details)

      // CODE BLOCKS - treated as executable
      ```bash
      npm test
      ```
      // Claude may run this or show it to user

      // Make it clear if code should run:
      Run this command:
      ```bash
      npm test
      ```

      // Or if it's just an example:
      Example output format (do not run):
      ```json
      {"status": "ok"}
      ```

      // CHECKLISTS - Claude tracks these
      - [ ] First task
      - [ ] Second task

      // Claude will try to complete checkboxes

      // HORIZONTAL RULES - can separate sections
      ---
      // Often used before "Usage:" comments

      // EMPHASIS - interpreted but subtle
      **Important**: Do not skip this step.
      *Optional*: You may also...

      // ESCAPING - when needed
      Show the literal text: `$ARGUMENTS`
      // Backticks prevent substitution

      // LINKS - typically ignored
      [Documentation](https://...)
      // Claude won't fetch these

      // TABLES - work but complex
      | Column | Column |
      |--------|--------|
      | Data   | Data   |
    symptoms:
      - Unexpected code execution
      - Lost formatting in output
      - Sections merged or separated wrong
    detection_pattern: '```.*```.*```|# #|---.*---'

  - id: command-length-limits
    summary: Very long commands get truncated or cause issues
    severity: medium
    situation: Complex command doesn't execute completely
    why: |
      Commands add to context window.
      Very long commands crowd out conversation.
      Claude may not process all sections.
    solution: |
      // Managing command length

      // PROBLEM: Huge command with everything
      // .claude/commands/full-workflow.md (500+ lines)
      # Complete Development Workflow
      ## Research... (100 lines)
      ## Design... (100 lines)
      ## Implement... (100 lines)
      ## Test... (100 lines)
      ## Deploy... (100 lines)

      // SOLUTION: Modular commands
      // .claude/commands/research.md
      # Research: $ARGUMENTS
      [focused research workflow]

      // .claude/commands/implement.md
      # Implement: $ARGUMENTS
      [focused implementation workflow]

      // .claude/commands/test.md
      # Test: $ARGUMENTS
      [focused testing workflow]

      // PATTERN: Index command that chains
      // .claude/commands/workflow.md
      # Full Workflow: $ARGUMENTS

      This workflow consists of these steps:
      1. /research $ARGUMENTS
      2. /implement $ARGUMENTS
      3. /test $ARGUMENTS

      Start with step 1.

      // PATTERN: Reference files instead of inline
      // Instead of 100 lines of checklist:
      ## Review Checklist
      @.claude/checklists/security-review.md

      // GUIDELINE: Commands should be <100 lines
      // If longer, consider splitting or using @references
    symptoms:
      - Claude ignores later sections
      - Context window fills up fast
      - Slow command execution
    detection_pattern: ''

  - id: command-conflict-with-builtin
    summary: Custom command shadows built-in command
    severity: low
    situation: Built-in feature stops working after adding command
    why: |
      Some slash names are reserved.
      Custom commands can shadow built-ins.
      No warning when conflict occurs.
    solution: |
      // Reserved command names to avoid

      // BUILT-IN COMMANDS (don't override):
      /help          # Shows help
      /clear         # Clears conversation
      /config        # Configuration
      /memory        # Memory management
      /compact       # Compact conversation
      /model         # Model selection
      /bug           # Bug reporting
      /hooks         # Hook management
      /mcp           # MCP server management
      /permissions   # Permission management
      /init          # Initialize Claude Code

      // SAFE TO USE:
      /feature       # Custom
      /review        # Custom
      /deploy        # Custom
      /db            # Custom
      /test          # Custom (different from test command)
      /debug         # Custom
      /issue         # Custom

      // NAMING CONVENTIONS:
      // Use descriptive names: /code-review not /cr
      // Use kebab-case: /security-scan not /securityScan
      // Prefix team commands: /team-deploy, /team-release

      // If you accidentally override:
      // Rename your command file
      // .claude/commands/my-help.md instead of help.md
    symptoms:
      - Built-in feature doesn't work
      - Wrong command executes
      - Help shows wrong content
    detection_pattern: 'help\\.md|clear\\.md|config\\.md|memory\\.md'
