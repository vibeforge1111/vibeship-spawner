# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Site Reliability Engineering
    insight: |
      SREs know reliability:
      - Error budgets balance velocity and stability
      - Toil elimination is continuous
      - Incident response needs runbooks
      - Postmortems prevent recurrence
      Reliability is a feature, not an accident.
    applies_when: "Setting up monitoring and incident response"

  - domain: Chaos Engineering
    insight: |
      Chaos engineers know resilience:
      - Systems fail in unexpected ways
      - Test failures in production
      - Graceful degradation is essential
      - Recovery time matters more than uptime
      If you haven't tested failure, you haven't tested.
    applies_when: "Designing for high availability"

  - domain: Platform Engineering
    insight: |
      Platform engineers know developer experience:
      - Self-service reduces friction
      - Golden paths guide best practices
      - Abstraction hides complexity
      - Documentation is part of the platform
      Good platforms make developers faster.
