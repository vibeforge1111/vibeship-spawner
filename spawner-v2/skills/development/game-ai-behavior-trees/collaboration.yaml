cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Robotics
    insight: |
      Robotics uses behavior trees for:
      - Autonomous navigation
      - Task sequencing
      - Failure recovery
      Game AI can learn from robotic BT patterns.
    applies_when: "Building complex autonomous behaviors"

common_combinations:
  - name: LLM-Enhanced NPC Behavior
    skills:
      - game-ai-behavior-trees
      - llm-npc-dialogue
      - game-development
    workflow: |
      1. Design behavior tree structure (game-ai-behavior-trees)
      2. Add LLM decision nodes (llm-npc-dialogue)
      3. Integrate with game systems (game-development)
