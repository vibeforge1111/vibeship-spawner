delegation:
  - trigger: "native iOS feature"
    delegate_to: ios-swift-specialist
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Feature requirements, JS interface needed"
    receive: "Native module implementation"

  - trigger: "design system"
    delegate_to: ui-design
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Platform constraints, component needs"
    receive: "Design tokens, component specs"

  - trigger: "testing strategy"
    delegate_to: test-architect
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Mobile testing challenges, async patterns"
    receive: "Test structure, mock strategies"

  - trigger: "CI/CD setup"
    delegate_to: devops
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Build requirements, signing setup"
    receive: "EAS config, deployment pipeline"

  - trigger: "performance issues"
    delegate_to: performance-hunter
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Symptoms, profiler output"
    receive: "Optimization recommendations"

collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I design RN architecture, then ios-swift-specialist implements native modules"
    - "I build screens, then devops sets up deployment"
    - "I identify performance issues, then performance-hunter profiles"

  parallel:
    - "I build components while ui-design creates design system"
    - "I implement features while test-architect writes tests"
    - "I develop screens while devops configures CI"

  review:
    - "Review ios-swift-specialist's native module interface"
    - "Review ui-design's component specs for feasibility"
    - "Review test-architect's test coverage"

cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: hybrid-apps
    insight: "Bridge overhead determines what runs in JS vs native"
    applies_when: "Deciding between JS and native implementation"

  - domain: mobile-ux
    insight: "60fps is table stakes - dropped frames are immediately visible"
    applies_when: "Building animations and interactions"

  - domain: platform-ecosystem
    insight: "Expo reduces complexity but limits native access"
    applies_when: "Choosing managed vs bare workflow"

  - domain: offline-first
