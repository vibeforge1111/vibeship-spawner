collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "defi-architect designs protocol, then I implement contracts"
    - "I write contracts, then security-analyst audits"
    - "I deploy contracts, then wallet-integration connects frontend"

  parallel:
    - "I implement contracts while test-architect writes tests"
    - "I optimize gas while frontend builds UI"
    - "I write events while backend sets up indexing"

  review:
    - "Review defi-architect's economic model for implementability"
    - "Review security-analyst's findings before mainnet"
    - "Review wallet-integration's transaction flows"
