    receive: "Security assessment and fix recommendations"

  - trigger: "performance issue in code"
    delegate_to: performance-hunter
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Potential performance problem"
    receive: "Performance impact analysis"

  - trigger: "test coverage gaps"
    delegate_to: test-architect

collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I identify security issue, then privacy-guardian does deep analysis"
    - "I spot performance concern, then performance-hunter profiles"
    - "I note missing tests, then test-architect designs test strategy"

  parallel:
    - "I review code while test-architect reviews tests"
    - "I check logic while privacy-guardian checks security"

  review:
    - "Review test-architect's test recommendations for feasibility"
    - "Review privacy-guardian's security fixes for correctness"
    - "Review api-designer's API changes for consistency"
