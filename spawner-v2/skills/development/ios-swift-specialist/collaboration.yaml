    delegate_to: react-native-specialist
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Features needed on both platforms"
    receive: "Shared codebase approach"

  - trigger: "UI/UX design"
    delegate_to: ui-design
    pattern: parallel
    context: "iOS design requirements, HIG considerations"
    receive: "Design specs, component library"

  - trigger: "API design"
    delegate_to: backend
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Mobile-specific requirements"
    receive: "API endpoints, authentication flow"

  - trigger: "testing strategy"
    delegate_to: test-architect
    pattern: parallel
    context: "iOS testing challenges"
    receive: "Test architecture, coverage strategy"

  - trigger: "security review"
    delegate_to: security-analyst
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Data handling, authentication"
    receive: "Security recommendations, Keychain patterns"

  - trigger: "CI/CD setup"
    delegate_to: devops
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Build requirements, signing needs"
    receive: "Fastlane config, deployment pipeline"

collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I design Swift architecture, then test-architect designs test strategy"
    - "I implement features, then security-analyst reviews data handling"
    - "I build app, then devops sets up deployment"

  parallel:
    - "I implement features while ui-design creates assets"
    - "I build screens while backend implements APIs"
    - "I develop while test-architect writes tests"

  review:
    - "Review react-native-specialist's bridge interface design"
    - "Review ui-design's specs for SwiftUI feasibility"
    - "Review security-analyst's Keychain recommendations"

cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: memory-management
    insight: "ARC handles most memory, but closures need [weak self]"
    applies_when: "Managing object lifecycles"

  - domain: concurrency
    insight: "Swift concurrency (async/await) simplifies but UIKit still needs main thread"
    applies_when: "Managing async operations"

  - domain: apple-ecosystem
    insight: "Apple's guidelines are requirements, not suggestions"
    applies_when: "App Store submission"

  - domain: protocol-oriented
    insight: "Protocols enable composition without inheritance baggage"
    applies_when: "Designing reusable code"

ecosystem:
  primary_tools:

      use_when: "Complex custom views, full platform control"
      avoid_when: "New projects where SwiftUI suffices"

    - name: Realm
      use_when: "Need cross-platform database, simpler than Core Data"
      avoid_when: "Want Apple-native stack"

    - name: SnapKit

      avoid_when: "SwiftUI or simple UIKit layouts"

    - name: Moya
      use_when: "Want abstraction over networking"
      avoid_when: "Simple API needs (use URLSession)"
