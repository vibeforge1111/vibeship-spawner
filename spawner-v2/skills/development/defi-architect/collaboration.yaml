collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I design protocol, then smart-contract-engineer implements"
    - "I define economics, then security-analyst reviews attack vectors"
    - "I specify user flows, then wallet-integration builds frontend"

  parallel:
    - "I design tokenomics while product-manager researches users"
    - "I model yields while data-engineering builds tracking"
    - "I iterate design while backend builds infrastructure"

  review:
    - "Review smart-contract-engineer's implementation for econ accuracy"
    - "Review security-analyst's attack vector analysis"
    - "Review data-engineering's metrics for protocol health"
