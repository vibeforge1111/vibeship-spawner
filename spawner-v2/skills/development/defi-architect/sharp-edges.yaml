  - id: impermanent-loss
    summary: LP positions lose value compared to holding
    severity: high
    situation: Providing liquidity to AMMs
    why: |
      Deposit 1 ETH + 2000 USDC when ETH = $2000.
      ETH goes to $4000. Pool rebalances to 0.707 ETH + 2828 USDC.
      Value: $5656. If you just held: $6000.
      Lost $344 (5.7%) to impermanent loss.
      It's only "impermanent" if price returns. Usually it doesn't.
    solution: |
      1. Calculate IL before providing:
         // IL = 2 * sqrt(priceRatio) / (1 + priceRatio) - 1
         // 2x price move = -5.7%
         // 5x price move = -25.5%

      2. Only LP when fees compensate:
         // Daily fees * 365 > Expected IL
         // High volume, stable pairs = good
         // Low volume, volatile pairs = bad

      3. Use concentrated liquidity wisely:
         // Uniswap V3: Higher capital efficiency
         // But IL is amplified if price moves out of range

      4. Consider single-sided staking:
         // Many protocols offer staking without IL
         // Lower yield but no IL risk

      5. Hedge with options if available
    symptoms:
      - LP position worth less than initial deposit
      - "I would have made more just holding"
      - Losses during volatile periods
    detection_pattern: 'addLiquidity|deposit.*pair|LP.*token'

  - id: oracle-latency-exploit
    summary: Stale oracle prices enable arbitrage
    severity: critical
    situation: Protocols depending on price feeds
    why: |
      Chainlink updates every X% price movement or heartbeat.
      During volatile moves, on-chain price lags real price.
      Attacker sees real price moved 10%, oracle shows old price.
      Borrows at old (favorable) price, sells at real price, profits.
    solution: |
      1. Check oracle freshness:
         (, , , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
         require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < MAX_DELAY, "Stale price");

      2. Use circuit breakers:
         uint256 lastPrice = previousPrices[token];
         require(
             newPrice > lastPrice * 95 / 100 &&
             newPrice < lastPrice * 105 / 100,
             "Price deviation too large"
         );

      3. Multiple oracle sources:
         // Only proceed if sources agree within tolerance

      4. Pause protocol during extreme volatility:
         if (volatility > threshold) {
             _pause();
         }

      5. Use TWAP for large operations
    symptoms:
      - Arbitrageurs profiting from protocol
      - Bad debt accumulating
      - Unexpected liquidations/mints
    detection_pattern: 'latestRoundData|getPrice(?!.*staleness|.*freshness)'

  - id: flash-loan-attack
    summary: Attacker uses flash loan to manipulate protocol
    severity: critical
    situation: Any protocol with external price dependencies
    why: |
      Flash loan $100M → Manipulate DEX price → Exploit your protocol
      at manipulated price → Repay loan → Profit.
      All in one transaction. Zero capital required.
      Hundreds of millions stolen via flash loans.
    solution: |
      1. Use TWAP instead of spot price:
         // 30-minute TWAP can't be manipulated in one block
         uint256 price = twapOracle.consult(token, 1800);

      2. Block same-transaction dependencies:
         mapping(address => uint256) lastInteraction;

         modifier noFlashLoan() {
             require(lastInteraction[msg.sender] < block.number);
             lastInteraction[msg.sender] = block.number;
             _;
         }

      3. Use external oracles (Chainlink):
         // Decentralized, not manipulable by on-chain activity

      4. Delay sensitive operations:
         // Commit-reveal or time delays

      5. Limit single-transaction impact:
         require(amount < maxPerTransaction);
    symptoms:
      - Massive loss in single transaction
      - Protocol drained
      - Price spike then immediate reversal
    detection_pattern: 'getReserves|balanceOf.*this.*price'

  - id: governance-attack
    summary: Attacker accumulates votes to pass malicious proposal
    severity: critical
    situation: On-chain governance
    why: |
      Flash loan governance tokens → Vote for malicious proposal →
      Execute (drain treasury) → Repay tokens.
      Or: Buy tokens, pass proposal, sell tokens.
      Beanstalk lost $180M this way.
    solution: |
      1. Time-lock all proposals:
         uint256 public constant TIMELOCK = 2 days;
         require(block.timestamp > proposal.createdAt + TIMELOCK);

      2. Snapshot voting at proposal creation:
         // Votes counted from snapshot BEFORE proposal
         // Flash loans don't help

      3. Quorum requirements:
         require(votes > totalSupply * 4 / 100);  // 4% quorum

      4. Vote delegation requirements:
         // Must delegate before proposal
         // Prevents buying votes

      5. Emergency pause capability:
         // Multisig can pause malicious proposals
    symptoms:
      - Large token movements before vote
      - Unusual proposals passing
      - Treasury/parameter changes
    detection_pattern: 'propose|vote|execute|governance'

  - id: insufficient-liquidity
    summary: Liquidations fail during market stress
    severity: critical
    situation: Lending protocol liquidations
    why: |
      Normal times: Liquidators compete, bad debt cleared.
      Market crash: Everyone underwater, DEXs drained, no liquidity.
      Liquidators can't sell collateral → Don't liquidate.
      Bad debt accumulates, protocol becomes insolvent.
    solution: |
      1. Over-collateralization buffer:
         // 150% collateral ratio with 125% liquidation threshold
         // 25% buffer for price moves during liquidation

      2. Partial liquidations:
         // Liquidate 50% at a time
         // Reduces market impact

      3. Liquidation incentives:
         // Higher bonus during stress
         uint256 bonus = baseBonus + stressMultiplier;

      4. Protocol-owned liquidity:
         // Treasury can liquidate as backstop

      5. Insurance fund:
         // Cover bad debt from reserves

      6. Circuit breakers:
         // Pause new borrows in extreme conditions
    symptoms:
      - Bad debt accumulating
      - Liquidations not happening
      - Protocol token price crashing
    detection_pattern: 'liquidate|collateral|healthFactor'

  - id: reward-gaming
    summary: Users game reward mechanics for outsized returns
    severity: high
    situation: Liquidity mining, yield farming
    why: |
      Protocol: "Earn 100% APY for providing liquidity!"
      Whale: Deposit $100M right before snapshot, collect rewards,
      withdraw after. Dilutes rewards for real users.
      Or: Create many wallets to maximize per-wallet rewards.
    solution: |
      1. Time-weighted rewards:
         // reward = balance * time_held / total_weighted
         uint256 timeWeight = block.timestamp - depositTime;
         uint256 reward = balance * timeWeight * rewardRate;

      2. Vesting periods:
         // Rewards vest over 90 days
         // Early exit = forfeit unvested

      3. Lock-up requirements:
         // Must lock for X days to earn rewards
         require(block.timestamp > depositTime + lockPeriod);

      4. Decay function:
         // Rewards decrease over time
         // Early LPs rewarded more

      5. Merkle drops based on historical behavior:
         // Reward past genuine usage, not new gaming
    symptoms:
      - Whale deposits/withdrawals around snapshots
      - Many small identical wallets
      - APY much lower than advertised
    detection_pattern: 'claimReward|harvest|pendingReward'

  - id: cross-chain-bridge-exploit
    summary: Bridge verification flaws allow fake deposits
    severity: critical
    situation: Multi-chain protocols with bridges
    why: |
      Bridge verifies deposits on Chain A to mint on Chain B.
      Flaw in verification: Attacker fakes deposit proof.
      Mints unlimited tokens on Chain B. Sells, drains liquidity.
      Billions lost in bridge hacks (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad).
    solution: |
      1. Multi-sig verification:
         // Require N of M validators to confirm deposit
         require(confirmations >= threshold);

      2. Finality requirements:
         // Wait for source chain finality
         require(sourceBlocksConfirmed >= finalityBlocks);

      3. Amount limits:
         // Max transfer per transaction
         // Max transfer per hour/day
         require(dailyTransferred + amount <= dailyLimit);

      4. Delay for large transfers:
         // Large transfers have 24h delay
         if (amount > largeThreshold) {
             require(block.timestamp > submitTime + delay);
         }

      5. Emergency pause:
         // Guardian can freeze bridge

      6. Proof verification:
         // Multiple independent verifiers
         // Formal verification of bridge logic
    symptoms:
      - Tokens minted without deposits
      - Imbalance between chains
      - Large unexplained mints
    detection_pattern: 'bridge|crossChain|mint.*verify'

  - id: composability-risk
    summary: Integrating protocols creates unexpected attack vectors
    severity: high
    situation: DeFi protocols integrated with other protocols
    why: |
      Your protocol integrates Aave, Compound, Uniswap.
      Aave upgrades: Your integration breaks.
      Uniswap pool manipulated: Your collateral valuation wrong.
      Each integration adds risk surface. Composition multiplies risks.
    solution: |
      1. Interface abstraction:
         // Don't hardcode external protocol logic
         interface ILending {
             function deposit(uint256 amount) external;
         }

      2. Integration circuit breakers:
         // Pause specific integrations if issues
         mapping(address => bool) public pausedIntegrations;

      3. Conservative assumptions:
         // Assume external protocols can be manipulated
         // Don't trust their spot prices

      4. Regular integration audits:
         // Check for upstream changes

      5. Graceful degradation:
         // Protocol works (reduced functionality) if integration fails

      6. Position limits:
         // Max exposure to any single integration
    symptoms:
      - Unexpected behavior after external upgrades
      - Losses from external protocol exploits
      - Integration timeouts/failures
    detection_pattern: 'external.*contract|integration|compound|aave|uniswap'
