  - id: alter-table-lock
    summary: ALTER TABLE locks entire table, blocks all writes
    severity: critical
    situation: Adding column or constraint to large table
    why: |
      ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN new_col TEXT;
      On 100M row table, this can take hours. During that time, table is locked.
      All writes blocked. Application times out. Users see errors.
    solution: |
      1. For PostgreSQL, use CONCURRENTLY where possible:
         CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx ON table (col);

      2. For adding nullable column (fast in PostgreSQL 11+):
         ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN new_col TEXT;  -- Instant if nullable

      3. For adding column with default (PostgreSQL 11+):
         ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN new_col TEXT DEFAULT 'value';  -- Also instant

      4. For older PostgreSQL or other DBs:
         # 1. Add nullable column (fast)
         ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN new_col TEXT;
         # 2. Backfill in batches
         UPDATE memories SET new_col = 'value'
         WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 10000;
         # 3. Add NOT NULL constraint
         ALTER TABLE memories ALTER COLUMN new_col SET NOT NULL;

      5. Use pg_repack for table rewrites:
         pg_repack -d mydb -t memories
    symptoms:
      - Application timeouts during migration
      - "lock wait timeout exceeded"
      - Writes queuing behind ALTER TABLE
    detection_pattern: 'ALTER TABLE|ADD COLUMN|DROP COLUMN|ADD CONSTRAINT'

  - id: foreign-key-add-scan
    summary: Adding foreign key scans entire table for validation
    severity: high
    situation: Adding foreign key constraint to existing table
    why: |
      ALTER TABLE memories ADD CONSTRAINT fk_agent
        FOREIGN KEY (agent_id) REFERENCES agents(id);

      PostgreSQL must verify every row satisfies constraint.
      10M rows = full table scan = minutes to hours.
      Lock held during validation.
    solution: |
      1. Add constraint as NOT VALID first (instant):
         ALTER TABLE memories
           ADD CONSTRAINT fk_agent
           FOREIGN KEY (agent_id) REFERENCES agents(id)
           NOT VALID;

      2. Validate separately (no lock on writes):
         ALTER TABLE memories VALIDATE CONSTRAINT fk_agent;

      3. Clean up invalid data first:
         DELETE FROM memories
         WHERE agent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM agents);
    symptoms:
      - Migration takes much longer than expected
      - Application blocked during constraint addition
      - "pending trigger events" errors
    detection_pattern: 'FOREIGN KEY|REFERENCES|ADD CONSTRAINT'

  - id: deploy-order-failure
    summary: Code and schema deployed in wrong order, breaks production
    severity: critical
    situation: Deploying code that depends on new schema before schema exists
    why: |
      New code does: SELECT new_column FROM memories;
      Deploy code first. Schema not updated yet.
      Boom: "column new_column does not exist".
      All requests fail.
    solution: |
      1. Schema changes MUST be backward compatible:
         # Phase 1: Add column (old code ignores it)
         # Phase 2: Deploy code that uses column (both work)
         # Phase 3: Remove old column support

      2. Use version checks in code:
         async def get_memory(id):
             if await schema_has_column('memories', 'new_col'):
                 return await db.fetch("SELECT new_col...")
             return await db.fetch("SELECT old_col...")

      3. Deploy order checklist:
         - [ ] Can old code run with new schema? (expand)
         - [ ] Can new code run with old schema? (optional but safer)
         - [ ] Rollback tested?

      4. Use database migrations with dependency tracking:
         # Alembic/Django migrations run before app starts
    symptoms:
      - Immediate errors after deployment
      - "column does not exist" or "table does not exist"
      - Works in staging, fails in production
    detection_pattern: 'deploy|release|migration.*order'

  - id: backfill-timeout
    summary: Backfill query times out or blocks production traffic
    severity: high
    situation: Updating existing rows with new column values
    why: |
      UPDATE memories SET embedding = compute_embedding(content);
      10M rows × 100ms each = 11.5 days. But transaction times out.
      Even without timeout, locks resources the whole time.
    solution: |
      1. Batch updates:
         DO $$
         DECLARE
             batch_size INT := 1000;
         BEGIN
             LOOP
                 UPDATE memories
                 SET embedding = compute_embedding(content)
                 WHERE embedding IS NULL
                   AND id IN (
                     SELECT id FROM memories
                     WHERE embedding IS NULL
                     LIMIT batch_size
                     FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
                 );
                 IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF;
                 COMMIT;
                 PERFORM pg_sleep(0.05);  -- Rate limit
             END LOOP;
         END $$;

      2. Use background job with progress tracking:
         class BackfillJob:
             async def run(self):
                 last_id = await self.get_checkpoint()
                 while True:
                     rows = await self.process_batch(after=last_id)
                     if not rows:
                         break
                     last_id = rows[-1].id
                     await self.save_checkpoint(last_id)

      3. Accept eventual consistency:
         # New rows get value immediately
         # Old rows backfilled asynchronously
         # Handle NULL in code during transition
    symptoms:
      - Migration times out
      - Production slowed during backfill
      - "statement timeout" errors
    detection_pattern: 'UPDATE.*SET.*WHERE|backfill|batch'

  - id: rollback-data-loss
    summary: Rollback loses data written after migration
    severity: critical
    situation: Rolling back migration that changed column type or structure
    why: |
      Migrate: Change status from string to enum.
      New code writes enum values.
      Rollback: Old code can't read enum values.
      Either crash or data corruption.
    solution: |
      1. Make migrations reversible:
         # Forward: Add new column, backfill, switch
         # Reverse: Switch back, drop new column
         # No data loss either direction

      2. Don't delete data during expand phase:
         # Keep old column until contract phase
         # Can always roll back to reading old column

      3. Version your data:
         UPDATE memories
         SET data = jsonb_set(data, '{version}', '2')
         WHERE ...

      4. Plan for rollback data handling:
         # Document: "Rows created after migration will need X on rollback"
    symptoms:
      - "Cannot deserialize" after rollback
      - Data corruption after rollback
      - New records missing after rollback
    detection_pattern: 'rollback|revert|undo|backward'

  - id: index-creation-lock
    summary: CREATE INDEX blocks writes on table
    severity: high
    situation: Adding index to large table
    why: |
      CREATE INDEX idx_agent ON memories (agent_id);
      Holds write lock for entire index build duration.
      On 100M rows, could be 30+ minutes.
      All inserts/updates blocked.
    solution: |
      1. Use CONCURRENTLY (PostgreSQL):
         CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_agent ON memories (agent_id);
         -- Takes longer but doesn't lock

      2. Handle concurrent index failure:
         # CONCURRENTLY can fail, leaving invalid index
         DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_agent;
         CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_agent ON memories (agent_id);

      3. Schedule during low traffic:
         # Even CONCURRENTLY adds load
         # Run during maintenance window if possible

      4. Monitor replication lag:
         # Large index builds cause replica lag
    symptoms:
      - Writes blocked during index creation
      - "canceling statement due to lock timeout"
      - Index marked as INVALID after failure
    detection_pattern: 'CREATE INDEX|DROP INDEX|CONCURRENTLY'

  - id: trigger-cascade-explosion
    summary: Trigger causes cascade of updates during migration
    severity: high
    situation: Migration with triggers or cascading foreign keys
    why: |
      UPDATE parent SET status = 'archived';
      Trigger on parent updates all children.
      Cascade to grandchildren.
      1 row becomes 10,000 updates.
      Transaction log explodes. Migration takes hours.
    solution: |
      1. Disable triggers during bulk operations:
         ALTER TABLE memories DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;
         -- Do migration --
         ALTER TABLE memories ENABLE TRIGGER ALL;

      2. Use session_replication_role:
         SET session_replication_role = replica;
         -- Triggers don't fire --
         SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

      3. Be aware of cascade effects:
         # Check for ON UPDATE CASCADE, ON DELETE CASCADE
         # Estimate affected row counts

      4. Consider disabling foreign keys temporarily:
         ALTER TABLE child DROP CONSTRAINT fk_parent;
         -- Migrate --
         ALTER TABLE child ADD CONSTRAINT fk_parent ...;
    symptoms:
      - Migration much slower than expected
      - Transaction log growing rapidly
      - Unexpected rows being modified
    detection_pattern: 'trigger|cascade|ON UPDATE|ON DELETE'
