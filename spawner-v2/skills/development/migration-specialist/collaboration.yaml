collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I plan migration, then postgres-wizard reviews for locks"
    - "I define schema change, then data-engineer builds backfill"
    - "I design rollback, then infra-architect automates it"

  parallel:
    - "I run migration while observability-sre monitors"
    - "I write migration while test-architect writes tests"

  review:
    - "Review postgres-wizard's index suggestions for migration impact"
    - "Review data-engineer's backfill plan for compatibility"
    - "Review infra-architect's blue-green setup for migration needs"
