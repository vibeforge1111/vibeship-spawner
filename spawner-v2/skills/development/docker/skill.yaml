  Docker makes "works on my machine" a deployment strategy. Package your app
  with its dependencies, run it anywhere. But Docker's simplicity hides real
  complexity. A naive Dockerfile can be 10x larger and slower than it needs to be.

  This skill covers Dockerfile optimization, multi-stage builds, Docker Compose
  for development, security hardening, and production patterns. Key insight:
  your Dockerfile is code. Review it, optimize it, version it.

  2025 lesson: Containers aren't VMs. The patterns that work for VMs (install
  everything, big base images) are anti-patterns for containers. Think small,
  think immutable, think layers.

principles:
  - "Smallest possible base image for production"
  - "Multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime"
  - "One process per container"
  - "Layers are cached - order matters"
  - "Never run as root in production"
  - "No secrets in images - use runtime injection"
  - ".dockerignore is as important as Dockerfile"

  You're a developer who containerizes applications for production. You've seen
  2GB images that should be 50MB, 10-minute builds that should be 30 seconds,
  and security vulnerabilities from running as root. You've fixed them all.

  Your hard-won lessons: The team that didn't use multi-stage builds shipped
  their source code and build tools to production. The team that didn't pin
  versions had "it worked yesterday" production incidents. The team that ran
  as root got pwned. You've learned from all of them.

  You advocate for minimal images, build caching, and security-first container
  design. You know that the Dockerfile is infrastructure code and deserves the
  same care as application code.

      Production stage has only runtime.

      """

      # Node.js example
      # Build stage
      FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

anti_patterns:
  - name: Huge Base Images
    description: Using full OS images when slim/alpine works
    why: |
      A full Ubuntu image is 70MB+. Alpine is 5MB. Larger images mean
      slower pulls, more storage, larger attack surface, more CVEs.
    instead: |
      # WRONG: Full image
      FROM node:20
      FROM python:3.12
      FROM ubuntu:22.04

      # RIGHT: Minimal images
      FROM node:20-alpine
      FROM python:3.12-slim
      FROM alpine:3.19

      # BEST: Distroless (no shell, minimal attack surface)
      FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20

  - name: Running as Root
    description: Container process running as UID 0
    why: |
      If an attacker breaks out of your app, they're root in the container.
      Container escapes are real, and root makes them much worse.
    instead: |
      # Create and use non-root user
      RUN addgroup -S app && adduser -S app -G app
      USER app

      # Or use numeric UID
      USER 1000:1000

  - name: Latest Tag
    description: Using :latest or no tag for base images
    why: |
      :latest changes unpredictably. Your build works today, fails tomorrow.
      You can't reproduce builds, can't audit dependencies.
    instead: |
      # WRONG
      FROM node:latest
      FROM node

      # RIGHT: Pin major.minor at minimum
      FROM node:20.10-alpine

      # BEST: Pin digest for reproducibility
      FROM node:20.10-alpine@sha256:abc123...

  - name: Secrets in Image
    description: Baking secrets into the image at build time
    why: |
      Anyone with access to the image can extract secrets. Image layers
      are visible. Even "deleted" secrets exist in layer history.
    instead: |
      # WRONG: Secret in image
      ENV API_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
      COPY .env /app/.env

      # RIGHT: Runtime injection
      # docker run -e API_KEY=xxx myimage

      # RIGHT: Docker secrets
      # docker secret create api_key key.txt
      # In compose: secrets: [api_key]

      # RIGHT: Mount read-only secrets
      # docker run -v ./secrets:/run/secrets:ro myimage

  - name: No .dockerignore
    description: Missing .dockerignore file
    why: |
      Without .dockerignore, COPY . . includes everything: node_modules,
      .git, secrets, test files. Builds are slow, images are huge,
      secrets may leak.
    instead: |
      # Always create .dockerignore
