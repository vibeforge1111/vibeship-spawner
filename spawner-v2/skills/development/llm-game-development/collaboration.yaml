cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Software Engineering
    insight: |
      Enterprise software has mature AI-assisted dev practices:
      - Spec-first development
      - Test-driven generation
      - Architecture documents as AI context
      - Code review checklists for AI output
      Games can adopt these proven workflows.
    applies_when: "Setting up AI-assisted game dev workflow"

  - domain: Pair Programming
    insight: |
      Treat LLM as pair programmer, not autonomous coder:
      - You drive (make decisions)
      - AI navigates (suggests, implements)
      - Constant review and course correction
      - Share context, verify output
    applies_when: "Day-to-day AI-assisted coding"

  - domain: Technical Writing
    insight: |
      Good prompts are good technical writing:
      - Clear requirements
      - Explicit constraints
      - Examples of expected output
      - Edge cases mentioned upfront
      Tech writing skills transfer to prompting.
    applies_when: "Crafting prompts for code generation"

  - domain: Quality Assurance
    insight: |
      QA mindset essential for AI code:
      - Assume bugs exist until proven otherwise
      - Test edge cases exhaustively
      - Regression testing after AI changes
      - Document AI-introduced bugs for patterns
    applies_when: "Reviewing AI-generated code"
