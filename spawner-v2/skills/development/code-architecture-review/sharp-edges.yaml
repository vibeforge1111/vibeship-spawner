  # --- CRITICAL: Will cause major rework ---

  - id: abstraction-before-duplication
    summary: Creating abstractions before you have concrete examples
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You see a pattern that might repeat, so you create an interface,
      abstract class, or generic solution before you have 2+ concrete
      implementations.
    why: |
      Premature abstraction creates the WRONG abstraction. You don't know
      the requirements yet. You'll either:
      1. Force future code to fit your bad abstraction
      2. Rewrite the abstraction when requirements become clear
      3. Work around it with hacks that defeat the purpose

      Wait for duplication. "Rule of three" - abstract on the third use.
    solution: |
      Write concrete code first. When you see ACTUAL duplication:
      1. Note what's the same and what's different
      2. Extract the common parts
      3. Parameterize the differences

      The pattern reveals itself through real usage.
    symptoms:
      - "We might need to support X someday"
      - Interface with one implementation
      - Generic<T> used with only one type
      - Abstract class with one child
    detection_pattern: 'interface.*\{[^}]+\}.*class.*implements'

  - id: circular-dependency-spiral
    summary: Circular dependencies that grow until the system is unmaintainable
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Module A imports from B, B imports from C, C imports from A.
      Or worse: A <-> B direct circular import.
    why: |
      Circular dependencies make it impossible to:
      - Load modules in a sensible order
      - Test modules in isolation
      - Understand the flow of data
      - Reason about side effects

      They grow over time. Adding "just one more import" is easy.
      The circular graph becomes load-bearing.
    solution: |
      Break the cycle:
      1. Extract shared logic into a new module both depend on
      2. Use dependency injection - pass dependencies in
      3. Create an interface in the "lower" module, implement in "higher"
      4. Use events/callbacks instead of direct calls

      # Before (circular)
      userService.ts -> orderService.ts -> userService.ts

      # After (broken cycle)
      userService.ts -> IOrderNotifier (interface)
      orderService.ts implements IOrderNotifier
      orderService.ts -> userService.ts (one direction only)
    symptoms:
      - "Cannot access X before initialization"
      - Import order matters
      - Webpack/bundler circular dependency warnings
      - Tests fail when run in different order
    detection_pattern: 'import.*from.*\.\..*import.*from.*\.\.'

  - id: god-module-accumulation
    summary: One module grows to handle everything because it's "convenient"
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      A module starts small but grows to 1000+ lines because it's easier
      to add code there than to create proper structure.
    why: |
      God modules become:
      - Impossible to test (too many dependencies)
      - Impossible to understand (too many responsibilities)
      - Merge conflict magnets (everyone touches them)
      - Performance problems (load everything for anything)

      They grow because adding code is easier than reorganizing.
    solution: |
      Split by responsibility, not by size:
      1. Identify distinct responsibilities (list them)
      2. Group related functions together
      3. Extract each group to its own module
      4. Use a facade if you need backward compatibility

      # Before: UserManager.ts (1500 lines)
      # After:
      userAuth.ts      -> login, logout, session
      userProfile.ts   -> update, preferences
      userBilling.ts   -> subscription, invoices
      userNotify.ts    -> email, push notifications
    symptoms:
      - File over 500 lines
      - "Where does this code go? Just put it in utils"
      - Need to import 10 things from one module
      - Tests for module take forever to run
    detection_pattern: 'export (function|const|class).*\n.*export.*\n.*export'

  # --- HIGH: Will cause ongoing friction ---

  - id: leaky-database-abstraction
    summary: Database implementation details leak into business logic
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Business logic contains SQL queries, Prisma/Drizzle syntax,
      or database-specific concepts like transactions and locks.
    why: |
      Business logic becomes tied to database choice. Changing databases
      requires rewriting business rules. Testing requires database setup.
      Business code is harder to read.
    solution: |
      Create a repository layer:

      # Bad: Business logic with DB details
      async function getActiveUsers() {
        return prisma.user.findMany({
          where: { status: 'active', deletedAt: null }
        });
      }

      # Good: Repository hides DB
      interface UserRepository {
        getActive(): Promise<User[]>;
      }

      class PrismaUserRepository implements UserRepository {
        getActive() {
          return prisma.user.findMany({
            where: { status: 'active', deletedAt: null }
          });
        }
      }

      # Business logic uses interface
      async function notifyActiveUsers(repo: UserRepository) {
        const users = await repo.getActive();
        // ...
      }
    symptoms:
      - SQL in component files
      - Prisma/Drizzle imports in non-db files
      - Tests need database to run
      - "We can't change databases because..."
    detection_pattern: 'prisma\.|\.findMany|\.findUnique|SELECT.*FROM'

  - id: implicit-coupling-through-globals
    summary: Modules communicate through global state instead of explicit parameters
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Functions rely on global variables, singletons, or module-level state
      rather than receiving what they need as parameters.
    why: |
      Hidden dependencies make code:
      - Untestable without mocking globals
      - Unpredictable (order matters)
      - Hard to parallelize
      - Impossible to reason about in isolation
    solution: |
      Pass dependencies explicitly:

      # Bad: Global state
      let currentUser: User | null = null;

      function createOrder(items: Item[]) {
        if (!currentUser) throw new Error('Not logged in');
        return { userId: currentUser.id, items };
      }

      # Good: Explicit dependency
      function createOrder(user: User, items: Item[]) {
        return { userId: user.id, items };
      }
    symptoms:
      - Module-level `let` variables
      - Functions that "just work" without visible inputs
      - Tests failing when run in different order
      - "You have to call X before Y"
    detection_pattern: 'let [a-z]+\s*[:=].*\nexport'

  - id: wrong-layer-responsibilities
    summary: UI components contain business logic, or data layer contains validation
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Logic is placed in the wrong architectural layer:
      - Business rules in React components
      - Validation in database layer
      - API calls directly from UI
    why: |
      Wrong placement causes:
      - Duplicate logic (same validation in UI and API)
      - Untestable business rules (need to render component)
      - Tight coupling to presentation framework
    solution: |
      Put logic in the right layer:

      Presentation (React):
      - Display state
      - Handle user events
      - Call application layer

      Application (use cases):
      - Orchestrate business operations
      - Validate business rules
      - Call domain and infrastructure

      Domain (business logic):
      - Pure functions
      - Business rules
      - No external dependencies

      Infrastructure (external services):
      - Database access
      - API calls
      - File system
    symptoms:
      - Business logic in useEffect
      - Validation in database triggers
      - fetch() in components
      - Can't reuse logic in different UI
    detection_pattern: 'useEffect.*fetch|useState.*validate'

  # --- MEDIUM: Should fix for maintainability ---

  - id: string-typing-everywhere
    summary: Using strings where enums or union types should exist
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Status fields, type discriminators, and options passed as strings
      rather than typed enums or union types.
    why: |
      Strings are:
      - Not autocomplete-friendly
      - Not typo-proof
      - Not refactor-safe
      - Not self-documenting
    solution: |
      # Bad
      function setStatus(status: string) { ... }
      setStatus('actve'); // Typo, no error

      # Good
      type Status = 'active' | 'inactive' | 'pending';
      function setStatus(status: Status) { ... }
      setStatus('actve'); // Type error!
    symptoms:
      - Comparing strings with ===
      - Typo bugs that reach production
      - Magic strings scattered in code
    detection_pattern: "status.*===.*['\"]|type.*===.*['\"]"

  - id: test-coupling-to-implementation
    summary: Tests break when refactoring even though behavior is unchanged
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Tests verify implementation details rather than behavior.
      Refactoring working code breaks tests.
    why: |
      Tests become a burden rather than a safety net.
      Developers avoid refactoring to avoid fixing tests.
      Test failures don't indicate real problems.
    solution: |
      Test behavior, not implementation:

      # Bad: Tests implementation
      test('calls database with correct query', () => {
        createUser({ name: 'Test' });
        expect(prisma.user.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
          data: { name: 'Test' }
        });
      });

      # Good: Tests behavior
      test('creates user with given name', async () => {
        const user = await createUser({ name: 'Test' });
        expect(user.name).toBe('Test');

        const saved = await getUser(user.id);
        expect(saved.name).toBe('Test');
      });
    symptoms:
      - Tests full of mocks
      - Refactoring breaks tests
      - Tests pass but bugs exist
      - Testing private methods
    detection_pattern: 'toHaveBeenCalledWith|mock\('

  - id: feature-folder-vs-type-folder
    summary: Organizing by file type instead of feature
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Code organized as components/, hooks/, utils/, api/
      instead of by feature like users/, orders/, payments/
    why: |
      Type-based organization:
      - Scatters related code across folders
      - Makes it hard to find everything for a feature
      - Creates import paths across the codebase
      - Makes deleting features error-prone

      Feature-based keeps related code together.
    solution: |
      # Bad: Type-based
      components/
        UserProfile.tsx
        OrderList.tsx
      hooks/
        useUser.ts
        useOrders.ts
      api/
        userApi.ts
        orderApi.ts

      # Good: Feature-based
      features/
        users/
          UserProfile.tsx
          useUser.ts
          userApi.ts
        orders/
          OrderList.tsx
          useOrders.ts
          orderApi.ts
    symptoms:
      - Imports from many directories for one feature
      - Hard to find all code for a feature
      - Deleting feature leaves orphaned files
    detection_pattern: 'components/.*hooks/.*api/'
