cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Information Retrieval
    insight: |
      IR teaches relevance ranking:
      - TF-IDF for importance scoring
      - Recency decay functions
      - Query-context matching
      Apply to context prioritization.
    applies_when: "Deciding what context to keep"

  - domain: Cognitive Science
    insight: |
      Human memory research shows:
      - Primacy and recency effects
      - Chunking for organization
      - Spaced repetition for retention
      LLMs exhibit similar patterns.
    applies_when: "Structuring prompts"
