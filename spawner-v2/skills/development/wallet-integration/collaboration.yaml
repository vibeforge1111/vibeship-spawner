delegation:
  - trigger: "contract ABI"
    delegate_to: smart-contract-engineer
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Required functions, expected behaviors"
    receive: "ABIs, function specs, gas estimates"

  - trigger: "DeFi flows"
    delegate_to: defi-architect
    pattern: sequential
    context: "User actions, protocol interactions"
    receive: "Transaction sequences, approval patterns"

  - trigger: "UI components"
    delegate_to: frontend
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Wallet state, connection status"
    receive: "React/Vue components, hooks"

  - trigger: "security review"
    delegate_to: security-analyst
    pattern: sequential
    context: "Signing flows, message formats"
    receive: "Security audit, recommendations"

  - trigger: "backend integration"
    delegate_to: backend
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Auth needs, indexing requirements"
    receive: "SIWE auth, event indexing"

  - trigger: "UX design"
    delegate_to: ui-design
    pattern: parallel
    context: "Wallet flows, transaction types"
    receive: "UI mockups, interaction patterns"

collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "smart-contract-engineer provides ABIs, then I implement integration"
    - "I build connection flow, then security-analyst reviews"
    - "defi-architect designs flows, then I implement transactions"

  parallel:
    - "I implement wallet hooks while frontend builds UI"
    - "I handle transactions while backend sets up indexing"
    - "I design flows while ui-design creates mockups"

  review:
    - "Review smart-contract-engineer's ABIs for frontend usability"
    - "Review security-analyst's transaction security findings"
    - "Review ui-design's connection flow for technical feasibility"

  - domain: ux-design
    insight: "Every prompt is a potential abandonment point"
    applies_when: "Designing wallet flows"

  - domain: cryptography
    insight: "Signatures prove identity without revealing secrets"
    applies_when: "Implementing authentication"

  - domain: distributed-systems
    insight: "Transactions are eventual - design for pending states"
    applies_when: "Building transaction UX"

  - domain: security
    insight: "Users are the last line of defense - help them"
    applies_when: "Showing transaction details"

  - domain: error-handling
    insight: "Wallets fail in creative ways - handle all of them"
    applies_when: "Implementing error handling"
