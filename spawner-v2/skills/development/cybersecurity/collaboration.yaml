# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Military Defense
    insight: |
      Military knows defense:
      - Defense in depth
      - Assume breach
      - Compartmentalization
      - Continuous monitoring
      - Rapid response
      Security is applied defense strategy.
    applies_when: "Designing security architecture"

  - domain: Physical Security
    insight: |
      Physical security knows access:
      - Perimeter protection
      - Identity verification
      - Access logging
      - Separation of duties
      - Visitor management
      Digital access mirrors physical access.
    applies_when: "Designing authentication and authorization"

  - domain: Epidemiology
    insight: |
      Epidemiologists know spread:
      - Containment limits damage
      - Early detection saves lives
      - Tracing finds sources
      - Immunization prevents spread
      Security incidents spread like disease.
    applies_when: "Incident response and containment"
