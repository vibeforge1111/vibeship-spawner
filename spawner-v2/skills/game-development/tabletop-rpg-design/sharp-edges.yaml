    title: Human Probability Intuition Is Wrong
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Designer creates mechanic thinking "33% seems reasonable for difficult tasks."
      Playtesters report success rates feel off. Investigations reveal fundamental
      misunderstanding of probability psychology.
    why: |
      Humans are terrible at intuiting probability. A 70% success rate FEELS like 50%.
      We overweight failures and remember them more vividly. Dice don't know they
      "should" succeed eventually. Streaks happen and feel rigged.

      Key misunderstandings:
      - "Due": Players expect success after multiple failures (gambler's fallacy)
      - "Should": 80% success over 100 rolls includes runs of 5+ failures
      - "Feels bad": 70% success means 30% of moments are disappointment
      - "Swingy": d20 variance hides competence more than designers expect

      Real numbers that match intuition:
      - 85%+ feels "reliable" to players
      - 50% feels like "coin flip chaos"
      - 30% feels like "almost never works"
      - "Difficult" tasks at 40% success feel PUNISHING
    solution: |
      Design for FEEL, not mathematical elegance:

      # Test your mechanics at a table, not in spreadsheets
      # What feels good:
      - Easy tasks: 95%+ (players get mad at 1-in-20 fails on "easy")
      - Standard tasks: 75-85% (mostly succeed, occasionally interesting failure)
      - Hard tasks: 60-70% (tense, meaningful risk)
      - Very hard tasks: 40-50% (feel like long shots)
      - Near impossible: 20-30% (miracle territory)

      # Give players agency over variance
      - Advantage/disadvantage for tactical play
      - Resources that ensure success (Stress in BitD)
      - "Take 10" or "working carefully" for low-stakes rolls

      # Frame failure expectations
      - "The dagger of truth succeeds 33% of the time, but reveals something useful even on failure" reframes the same odds.
    symptoms:
      - Playtesters say skills feel useless even with decent odds
      - Players hoard limited resources because failure feels inevitable
      - Crit-fishing becomes dominant strategy
      - Player frustration about character concept viability

  - id: hidden-complexity-explosion
    title: Modifier Stacking Creates Hidden Complexity
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Designer creates elegant base mechanic (2d6+stat). Then adds situational
      modifiers. Players at the table spend 2 minutes calculating before each roll.
    why: |
      Each individual modifier seems reasonable:
      - +1 for high ground? Sure.
      - +2 for flanking? Obvious.
      - -2 for darkness? Makes sense.
      - +1d6 for blessed weapon? Flavorful.

      But modifiers MULTIPLY, they don't add:
      - 4 possible modifiers = 16 combinations to check
      - 6 possible modifiers = 64 combinations
      - 8 possible modifiers = 256 combinations

      Each roll becomes: "Wait, do I have... high ground? Am I flanking?
      Is it dark? Is my weapon blessed? Did the bard give me inspiration?
      Am I exhausted? Is the enemy prone? What was my skill again?"
    solution: |
      MAXIMUM 3 modifier sources per roll:

      # Blades in the Dark approach:
      1. Base dice pool (from rating)
      2. +/- 1d from position/factors
      3. Optional: Push yourself, devil's bargain, assist

      # D&D 5e Advantage approach:
      - All situational modifiers → Advantage OR Disadvantage
      - They cancel out, no stacking
      - "You have advantage" = done

      # Bounded accuracy:
      - Modifiers cap at +/- 5 regardless of sources
      - Players don't need to count everything

      # Design rule:
      IF modifier calculation takes > 10 seconds, the system is too complex.
    symptoms:
      - Rolls take longer than actions
      - Players asking "wait, does X apply?"
      - Cheat sheets for modifier stacking
      - Rules lawyers dominating table time
      - New players feeling overwhelmed

  - id: special-case-proliferation
    title: Special Cases Accumulate Into Incoherence
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Designer wants to add flavor to different weapons. Creates unique rules for
      swords, axes, maces, polearms, etc. Players can't remember which rule applies.
    why: |
      Special cases seem flavorful in isolation:
      - "Maces ignore 2 points of armor" (sensible physics)
      - "Polearms get first strike against charges" (realistic)
      - "Daggers can be thrown as a bonus action" (cool versatility)
      - "Swords parry for +2 AC" (classic fencing)

      But in play:
      - Every weapon becomes an exception to look up
      - "What does my weapon do again?" every combat
      - Balance becomes impossible (one combo dominates)
      - Rule INTERACTIONS create geometric complexity
        (mace + charge + darkness + prone = 8 rules to check)

      The D&D 3.5 weapon table had 25+ unique properties.
      Nobody used them correctly.
    solution: |
      TEMPLATES over unique rules:

      # Weapon Tags (like Dungeon World)
      # Small set of reusable properties
      Tags: Close, Reach, Messy, Precise, Forceful, Slow
      - Sword: Close, Precise
      - Axe: Close, Messy
      - Polearm: Reach, Slow
      - Dagger: Close, Precise, +Thrown

      # Players learn 6 tags, not 25 special cases

      # Alternative: All weapons are functionally similar
      # "A sword and an axe are both d8 damage"
      # Flavor is fiction, not mechanics
      # This is the Blades in the Dark approach

      # The 80/20 rule:
      If 80% of your weapons are special in different ways,
      none of them are special. Standouts need standout contrast.
    symptoms:
      - Players asking weapon rules mid-combat
      - Optimization guides ranking weapons by special rules
      - One weapon becoming best due to rule combo
      - Designer adding more rules to fix balance
    detection_pattern: "special.*weapon|unique.*property|exception.*when"

  - id: skill-list-bloat
    title: Long Skill Lists Create Paradox of Choice
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Designer creates 40-skill list for verisimilitude. Players freeze during
      character creation. In play, obscure skills never trigger.
    why: |
      "We need Acrobatics AND Athletics" seems reasonable.
      "Animal Handling separate from Nature" makes sense.
      "Craft (Basket Weaving)" exists for completeness.

      Result:
      - Character creation takes an hour of skill allocation
      - Analysis paralysis on every roll: "Is this Athletics or Acrobatics?"
      - 20 skills that never come up in 95% of campaigns
      - Dump skills everyone ignores (Profession: Sailor)
      - GM adjudicates edge cases constantly

      Pathfinder 1e: 35 skills
      D&D 5e: 18 skills
      Blades in the Dark: 12 action ratings
      Apocalypse World: 5 stats

      Correlation: Fewer skills = faster, more decisive play
    solution: |
      # The 12-Skill Maximum Rule
      If you have more than 12 skills, you're splitting hairs.

      # Skill Collapse examples:
      # Instead of: Acrobatics, Athletics, Climb, Jump, Swim
      # Use: "Physical" or "Body"

      # Instead of: Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Performance
      # Use: "Influence" or "Sway"

      # Blades in the Dark's 12 Action Ratings:
      Attune, Command, Consort, Finesse, Hunt, Prowl,
      Skirmish, Study, Survey, Sway, Tinker, Wreck
      # Every action in the game maps to one of these.
      # No confusion about which skill applies.

      # Design test: Read your skill list.
      # For each skill, ask: "When did this LAST come up in a session?"
      # If you can't recall a specific instance, cut or merge it.
    symptoms:
      - Players cannot decide which skill to use
      - Skills with 0 ranks on every character sheet
      - Skill synergy rules adding complexity
      - Single-skill characters dominating identity
    detection_pattern: "skills:.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n.*\\n"

  - id: advancement-treadmill
    title: Advancement That Doesn't Change Play
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Characters level from 1 to 10. Monsters scale proportionally. The level 10
      experience is mechanically identical to level 1, just bigger numbers.
    why: |
      Designers add levels because players expect progression.
      Monsters scale with levels because CR must match.
      Result: Level 10 fighter hits +15 vs AC 25 (50% hit rate)
              Level 1 fighter hits +5 vs AC 15 (50% hit rate)

      The numbers changed. The EXPERIENCE is identical.

      This is the "treadmill":
      - You run faster, but the world runs faster too
      - Nothing you gained matters against level-appropriate foes
      - Low-level threats become trivial (boring, not empowering)
      - The game ignores its own world (why are level 20 bandits guarding this?)

      World of Warcraft suffers this: Level 60 content is abandoned.
      Tabletop games can choose differently.
    solution: |
      # Capability Expansion Over Number Inflation:

      Level 1: You can fight one enemy
      Level 5: You can fight multiple enemies (Cleave, etc.)
      Level 10: You can lead armies (mass combat rules unlock)

      # Bounded Accuracy (D&D 5e's innovation):
      - Bonuses don't scale as dramatically
      - Level 1 goblins still threaten level 10 characters (in numbers)
      - Ancient dragon is scary for mathematical reasons, not scaling

      # Blades in the Dark approach:
      - Crew tier provides narrative permission, not combat stats
      - Tier 3 crew can tackle Tier 3 scores
      - You don't become "stronger," you become more influential

      # OSR approach:
      - Levels provide HP/saves primarily
      - A level 10 fighter still rolls d20 + small modifier
      - Competence shows in survival, not domination

      # The Test: "Would a level 10 session PLAY differently than level 1?"
      # If it's just bigger damage vs bigger HP, you've failed.
    symptoms:
      - Players feeling no sense of growth
      - GM scaling all encounters to party level
      - Old content becoming "useless"
      - Players asking "what's the point of leveling?"
    detection_pattern: "\\+[0-9]+.*level|scale.*CR|appropriate.*level"

  - id: spotlight-hoarding-mechanics
    title: Mechanics That Concentrate Spotlight
    severity: high
    situation: |
      The Rogue has the only skill for picking locks. Every locked door means
      the Rogue acts while 4 other players watch. For 10 minutes. Repeatedly.
    why: |
      Specialists make sense in fiction (the party lockpick expert).
      But unique capabilities create:
      - Spotlight hoarding (one player for one challenge type)
      - Passive waiting (others have nothing to do)
      - Fragility (if the Rogue is absent, locked doors are impossible)
      - Boredom (the Fighter player during social intrigue scenes)

      Traditional party roles exacerbate this:
      - Only the Cleric heals (Cleric acts every combat recovery)
      - Only the Wizard knows Arcana (Wizard player during mysteries)
      - Only the Thief finds traps (Thief player during dungeons)
    solution: |
      # Shared Competence, Unique Excellence:

      Everyone can attempt to pick a lock at baseline.
      The Rogue does it better/faster/quieter.
      "Who wants to try?" instead of "Rogue, roll."

      # Group Actions (Blades in the Dark):
      One person leads, others can assist.
      Everyone participates. Best roller determines outcome.
      "The whole crew sneaks past the guards" involves everyone.

      # Scene Rotation Mechanics:
      Downtime activities give each character personal scenes.
      The Fighter's "training" scene, the Wizard's "research" scene.
      Mechanical prompts ensure spotlight rotation.

      # Multiple Solution Paths:
      Locked door? Rogue picks it, Fighter bashes it,
      Wizard finds a spell, Bard convinces someone to open it.
      No single solution path. Every character can contribute.

      # The 3-Player Test:
      Run your game with 3 players. Is one player passive
      for more than 10 minutes at a stretch? Fix that.
    symptoms:
      - One player acting while others watch
      - Class-specific moments excluding other players
      - Players leaving table during certain scenes
      - Session recaps focus on 1-2 characters

  - id: death-is-boring
    title: Permadeath Without Narrative Weight
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Character dies to random encounter. Player sits out for rest of session.
      New character appears next scene with minimal story justification.
    why: |
      Character death can be meaningful:
      - Heroic sacrifice (player choice)
      - Consequence of dramatic failure (climactic moment)
      - Stakes enforcement (decisions have weight)

      Character death is often meaningless:
      - Random crit from random monster
      - Cascade failure (death spiral)
      - "Welp, I'm dead. Here's my new guy, Derek."

      Meaningless death:
      - Player excluded from play (boring)
      - No narrative impact (just a speed bump)
      - Discourages investment (why bother with backstory?)
      - Can feel punitive (bad luck → punishment)
    solution: |
      # Graduated Consequences:

      Death should be the LAST consequence, not the first.
      1. Injury/Harm (short-term penalty)
      2. Trauma/Scars (long-term penalty)
      3. Debt/Obligation (narrative complication)
      4. Captured/Separated (removes from scene, not game)
      5. Death (final, meaningful, player-agreed)

      # Player Agency in Death:

      "You can survive, but [terrible consequence]. Or die here."
      Give the PLAYER the choice, not the dice.
      Death as player authorship, not random outcome.

      # The Blades in the Dark model:
      - Trauma removes characters (but they're alive)
      - Death requires specific fiction (not HP reaching zero)
      - Player can retire character instead of die

      # OSR model:
      - Death is common and expected
      - Character creation is 5 minutes
      - Investment is in the PARTY, not individuals
      - Replacement character enters immediately

      # Pick one philosophy and commit to it.
    symptoms:
      - Players detached from characters
      - Replacement characters that are basically the same
      - Sessions where someone dies early and sits out
      - Risk-averse play to avoid random death

  - id: initiative-bottleneck
    title: Initiative Systems That Kill Momentum
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Combat begins. Everyone rolls initiative. GM sorts. First player acts.
      15 minutes later, the last player in order takes their first turn.
    why: |
      Traditional initiative:
      1. Everyone rolls (1-2 minutes with 6 players)
      2. GM sorts and records (1 minute)
      3. Each turn takes 2-3 minutes
      4. With 5 enemies: 10 turns to cycle
      5. 20-30 minutes before player 6 acts again

      Players wait. Phones come out. Engagement dies.
      "It's your turn. What do you do?" "Wait, what happened?"

      Furthermore:
      - Initiative modifiers create fixed turn order
      - Fast characters ALWAYS go first (boring)
      - One player always waits longest (unfun)
    solution: |
      # Popcorn Initiative (13th Age):
      Current player chooses who goes next.
      "I fire my bow. Rogue, you're up!"
      Players stay engaged because they might be called.
      Last person before enemies picks first person after.

      # Side Initiative (B/X D&D):
      Each SIDE rolls once. Party goes or enemies go.
      Entire party acts in any order.
      "We go first - everyone, what do you do?"

      # Fiction-First (Dungeon World):
      No initiative roll. GM addresses whoever is in danger.
      "The orc swings at you - what do you do?"
      Spotlight moves based on fictional positioning.

      # Clock-Based (Blades in the Dark):
      No turns. Players describe actions, GM judges position/effect.
      Action flows narratively. "Clock fills" is the progress marker.

      # Speed-Based (but good):
      Fast turns (30-second timers enforced).
      Declare actions simultaneously, resolve in order.
      "I'm going to attack" / "I'm going to heal" - fast declarations.

      # The 2-Minute Rule:
      No single turn should take more than 2 minutes.
      If it does, your combat system is too complex.
    symptoms:
      - Players on phones during combat
      - Wakeup calls when it is finally your turn
      - Combat taking 60+ minutes
      - Players dreading initiative

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Player wants to buy rope. Book has 15 types of rope across 3 pages.
      15-minute shopping trip ensues. Adventure never starts.
    why: |
      Equipment lists aim for verisimilitude:
      - "We should have different types of rations"
      - "Silk rope vs hemp rope matters!"
      - "Prices for everything in the world"

      Result:
      - Character creation includes 30-minute shopping
      - Players ask "how much is a cow?" in every town
      - Encumbrance calculations never end
      - The game becomes a shopping simulator

      Nobody remembers if they bought a crowbar.
      The 10-foot pole meme exists because ITEMS DON'T MATTER
      except when they specifically do.
    solution: |
      # Load/Loadout Systems:

      Blades in the Dark: "Light, Normal, Heavy load."
      Choose a number, then decide what's in it DURING play.
      "I check my belt. Do I have chalk?" (check a box)

      # Abstract Wealth:
      Resources track (Poor/Moderate/Wealthy/Rich)
      "Can I afford a horse?" → Roll Resources.
      No prices. No counting coins.

      # Kit-Based:
      "Explorer's Kit: rope, torches, rations, climbing gear"
      Buy the kit. Don't itemize. Done.

      # The Dungeon World Approach:
      Adventuring Gear: 5 uses.
      "I check my pack for a mirror."
      "Yes, you have one. Mark 1 use of Adventuring Gear."

      # If players are shopping for more than 5 minutes,

  - id: social-combat-failure
    title: Social Mechanics That Feel Like Combat
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Designer creates elaborate social combat system. Players treat NPCs as HP
      bars to whittle down. Roleplay disappears. It's just "I roll Persuasion."
    why: |
      Social "combat" systems assume:
      - NPCs have "social HP" (influence points, resistance)
      - Players attack with skills (Intimidate for damage)
      - Victory = HP reaches zero

      This:
      - Removes roleplay ("I roll to convince him")
      - Makes NPCs into obstacles, not characters
      - Creates weird fiction ("I intimidated him 6 times, he's convinced")
      - Misunderstands human interaction (it's not hit points)
    solution: |
      # Disposition + Leverage (The Sprawl, etc.):
      NPCs have a stance: Hostile/Unfriendly/Neutral/Friendly/Helpful
      One roll determines if stance shifts.
      Leverage affects target difficulty.
      "She's Unfriendly. You need leverage to make her listen."

      # Fiction-First Social:
      What the player SAYS matters.
      A good argument changes the difficulty.
      The roll determines if delivery lands, not if the idea works.
      "That's a compelling point, roll with advantage."

      # NPC Wants and Fears:
      Every NPC has: Want, Fear, Weakness.
      Players discover these through roleplay.
      Knowing them gives mechanical advantage.
      "You found out he fears exposure. +2 to blackmail."

      # No Social HP:
      Single rolls with consequences.
      "On a failure, you've offended them. Stance worsens."
      Relationships aren't depleted, they're complicated.

      # The Roleplay Test:
      If your social system works identically with no acting,
      you've designed social combat. Consider if that's what you want.
    symptoms:

    situation: |
      Critical clue requires Perception check. Everyone fails. Investigation stalls.
      GM awkwardly forces the clue. Players feel stupid or cheated.
    why: |
      Traditional mystery design:
      - Clue exists in location
      - Player must roll Investigate to find it
      - Failure = no clue

      Problems:
      - Random failure halts plot
      - GM has to improvise backup
      - Players don't feel clever (just lucky)
      - Stakes of rolls are wrong (fail = boring, not interesting)
    solution: |
      # GUMSHOE System's Core Insight:
      Finding clues is automatic. The roll is for EXTRA information.
      "You find the bloodstain. Roll Forensics for details."
      Pass: "It's 3 hours old, the killer is left-handed."
      Fail: "It's blood. Human. Recent."
      Either way, investigation proceeds.

      # The Three-Clue Rule (Robin Laws):
      Every conclusion should have THREE paths to it.
      Miss one clue? Two others exist.
      Redundancy ensures progress.

      # Player-Facing Clues:
      Put the clue in the open. The INTERPRETATION is the puzzle.
      "You see the butler's shoes are muddy." (automatic)
      Players figure out what that means.

      # Fail Forward Investigation:
      Failure doesn't hide the clue.
      Failure adds complication (you find it, but they know you looked).
      Or time cost (you find it, but you're late to the rendezvous).

      # Never lock progression behind a single roll.

    why: |
      One-shots have different death calculus:
      - No resurrection coming next session
      - No time to build new character properly
      - Player excluded from remainder of experience
      - Narrative has no time to address death meaningfully

      Explicitly: "In this one-shot, death is not a consequence."
      Failure means capture, injury, complication - not removal.
      The story needs all protagonists for 4 hours.

      # Death as Endgame:
      Death only possible in climax.
      Dying in the final battle = heroic.
      Dying in hour 1 = sitting out.

      # Immediate Return:
      "Your ghost continues to aid the party."
      "You're unconscious but roll at disadvantage to advise."
      Mechanical presence continues even after "death."

      # Troupe Play:
      Each player has 2-3 characters.
      Death removes ONE character, player switches.
      Investment is distributed.

      # One-Shot-Specific Mechanics:
      Dread: Death = elimination, but that's the GENRE (horror).
      Everyone expects to die. The tower fall IS the drama.
      Know your game's relationship to death.
    symptoms:
      - Player sitting out of one-shot
      - New character appearing with no setup
      - Tension around death ruining fun
      - One-shots ending early due to TPK
    detection_pattern: "one-shot.*death|session.*character.*die"
