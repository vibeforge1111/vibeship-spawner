# ============================================================================
# COLLABORATION RULES
# ============================================================================
collaboration_rules:
  inbound:
    - rule: "Always clarify target art style before designing"
      reason: "A pixel art character design differs fundamentally from 3D realistic"

    - rule: "Get camera distance information early"
      reason: "Gameplay camera distance determines detail level and silhouette needs"

    - rule: "Understand the full cast before designing individuals"
      reason: "Characters must be distinct from each other, not just appealing alone"

    - rule: "Ask about animation needs upfront"
      reason: "Static concept art that can't animate wastes everyone's time"

    - rule: "Request cultural context for any culture-specific elements"
      reason: "Avoiding offense requires understanding before designing"

  outbound:
    - rule: "Always include silhouette version in handoffs"
      reason: "Proves design was tested and shows essential shape"

    - rule: "Provide exact color values, not descriptions"
      reason: "Implementers need hex/RGB, not 'blue'"

    - rule: "Include scale-specific notes for multi-scale implementation"
      reason: "What to keep vs remove at different sizes"

    - rule: "Document proportion ratios for consistency"
      reason: "Prevents proportion drift across assets"

    - rule: "Explain design intent, not just design"
      reason: "Why helps implementers make good decisions"

# ============================================================================
# INTEGRATION PATTERNS
# ============================================================================
integration_patterns:
  with_2d_implementation:
    setup: |
      Character design flows into 2D implementation:
      1. Full design created with all views
      2. Simplified for target resolution
      3. Color palette limited for sprite constraints
      4. Key poses provided for animation reference
      5. Scale-specific versions created
    common_issues:
      - "Design too detailed for pixel resolution"
      - "Colors too similar when limited to palette"
      - "Silhouette unreadable at gameplay size"

  with_3d_implementation:
    setup: |
      Character design flows into 3D implementation:
      1. Full turnaround with proportions
      2. Material notes for surface appearance
      3. Topology hints for deformation zones
      4. Joint locations marked
      5. Range of motion documented
    common_issues:
      - "Proportions impossible in 3D (foreshortening tricks)"
      - "Design relies on 2D cheats that don't work in 3D"
      - "Missing back view or unclear from certain angles"

  with_animation:
    setup: |
      Character design flows into animation:
      1. Key poses provided
      2. Expression sheet created
      3. Joint/pivot points marked
      4. Range of motion defined
      5. Secondary motion behavior noted
    common_issues:
      - "Hair/cloth has no defined behavior"
      - "Proportions break at extreme poses"
      - "Costume elements clip during movement"

  with_worldbuilding:
    setup: |
      Bidirectional flow with worldbuilding:
      - Worldbuilding provides cultural context
      - Character design embodies that context
      - Design reveals new world implications
      - Both evolve together
    common_issues:
      - "Design ignores world's technology level"
      - "Costume inappropriate for climate/setting"
      - "Character doesn't fit established faction visual"
