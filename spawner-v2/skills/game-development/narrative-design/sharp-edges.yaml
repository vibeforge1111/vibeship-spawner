    summary: Mechanics and story telling different stories without realizing it
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Creating a narrative about peace, redemption, or moral complexity while
      mechanics reward violence, efficiency, or binary outcomes. The story says
      one thing; the gameplay says another. Players feel the contradiction
      even if they can't articulate it.
    why: |
      Games are defined by their mechanics. Story is optional; play is not.
      When mechanics contradict story, mechanics win. The player who saves
      the orphanage in cutscene but murders for loot in gameplay doesn't
      believe they're a hero - they believe the story is fake.

      This is the single most common failure in game narrative. Spec Ops:
      The Line works because it makes dissonance THE THEME. Most games
      just hope players don't notice.
    solution: |
      AUDIT FOR ALIGNMENT:

      1. LIST YOUR THEME IN ONE SENTENCE
         "War is hell and has no winners."
         "Power corrupts absolutely."
         "Community is strength."

      2. LIST WHAT MECHANICS REWARD
         - Headshots: efficiency in violence
         - Gold: accumulation
         - XP: power growth

      3. FIND THE GAP
         If theme = "community" but mechanics = "solo optimization"
         YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

      4. CLOSE THE GAP (options):
         a) Change mechanics to match theme
            Hades: death advances story instead of blocking
         b) Change story to match mechanics
            DOOM: story is "kill demons," mechanics are "kill demons" - alignment
         c) Make dissonance the theme
            Spec Ops: "You did awful things. Why did you keep playing?"
         d) Add mechanical cost to dissonant actions
            Undertale: killing removes content, makes game worse

      NEVER: Hope players won't notice the gap.
    symptoms:
      - Reviews mention "story doesn't match gameplay"
      - Players skip cutscenes (story feels irrelevant)
      - Community jokes about protagonist being mass murderer
      - Serious story moments feel unearned

  - id: branching-that-collapses
    summary: Promising choice but converging to same outcome regardless
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Designing branching dialogue or quests where all paths lead to the same
      place. The branch is cosmetic - different lines, same result. Players
      who discover this stop believing ANY choice matters.
    why: |
      Branching is expensive. Writers and designers often create the illusion
      of branching (multiple options) without true divergence (different
      outcomes). This is worse than no branching because it trains players
      that their choices are meaningless.

      Once burned, players stop caring. "It doesn't matter anyway."
    solution: |
      THE REAL COST OF BRANCHING:

      2 branches = 2x content
      3 branches = 3x content
      Each branch that branches = exponential

      SUSTAINABLE BRANCHING STRATEGIES:

      1. DELAYED CONVERGENCE
         Branches diverge meaningfully, EVENTUALLY reconverge
         But convergence point is far enough to feel real
         Different JOURNEY, same destination (sometimes ok)

      2. STATE VARIATION, NOT PLOT VARIATION
         Same events happen, but:
         - Different relationships
         - Different reputation
         - Different dialogue lines
         - Different items available
         Real difference without exponential content

      3. SHORT BRANCHES, LONG MEMORY
         Branch converges quickly BUT
         NPCs remember, dialogue changes
         "You chose violence last time" affects future

      4. FEWER, BIGGER CHOICES
         3 major choices with real consequences
         Better than 30 cosmetic choices
         Witcher 3 approach: few, weighty, remembered

      5. BE HONEST ABOUT LIMITATIONS
         Some choices are personality expression
         Player knows it's "how I said it" not "what happens"
         Don't pretend otherwise

      TELLTALE GAMES LESSON:
      "Clementine will remember that" = expectation of consequence
      When consequences don't materialize = betrayal

      If you can't afford real branching, don't promise it.
    symptoms:
      - Players compare notes, discover same outcomes
      - Guides say "choice doesn't matter"
      - Community cynicism about decisions
      - Low replay motivation

  - id: cutscene-agency-theft
    summary: Removing player control for story beats that feel unearned
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Taking control away from the player for cutscenes that don't justify
      the interruption. Long cinematics after short gameplay. Cutscenes that
      make the player character act in ways the player wouldn't choose.
    why: |
      Players came to PLAY. Every second of cutscene is a second they're not
      playing. The exchange must be worthwhile - emotional payoff that requires
      directed cinematography. Otherwise, it's the designer saying "my story
      is more important than your play."

      Worse: when cutscene shows player character being stupid, getting
      captured, or acting out of character. The player just demonstrated
      competence. The cutscene says "none of that counted."
    solution: |
      CUTSCENE JUSTIFICATION FRAMEWORK:

      1. EARN THE CUTSCENE
         - 1 minute cutscene requires 10-20 minutes gameplay to earn
         - Boss cutscene after boss fight: earned
         - Opening cutscene before any play: risky

      2. MAINTAIN CAPABILITY CONSISTENCY
         - If player can dodge bullets in gameplay, character can in cutscene
         - If player is stealthy, character doesn't walk into trap
         - If player wins fight, cutscene doesn't show them losing

      3. ALLOW SKIP (always)
         - Returning players shouldn't re-watch
         - Some players don't care about story
         - Unskippable = punishment

      4. MAINTAIN SOME AGENCY
         - Camera control during slow moments
         - Minor interaction prompts
         - Dialogue choices within scene
         - "Hold to continue" for emotional beats

      5. IN-ENGINE OVER PRE-RENDERED
         - Players see their version of character
         - Equipment consistency
         - Less jarring transition

      HALF-LIFE APPROACH:
      Never take camera control.
      Story happens around player, not to player.
      More limiting but no agency complaints.

      METAL GEAR APPROACH:
      Extremely long cutscenes BUT
      Player knows this going in.
      It's part of the contract.
    symptoms:
      - Players complain about unskippable cutscenes
      - "Why is my character so dumb in cutscenes?"
      - Players put down controller during story
      - Gameplay momentum killed by interruptions

  - id: exposition-as-dialogue
    summary: Characters explaining lore instead of living it
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Using dialogue as a vehicle for world-building. NPCs who exist to
      explain the world. Conversations that are really just disguised
      encyclopedia entries. "As you know, the War of Three Kings..."
    why: |
      Real people don't explain things both parties already know.
      Exposition dialogue breaks immersion because it's not how humans talk.
      Players tune out, skip through, or lose interest in lore entirely.

      The game becomes a lecture instead of an experience.
    solution: |
      EXPOSITION ALTERNATIVES:

      1. ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING
         Don't explain the war - show the ruins.
         Don't explain the plague - show the empty village.
         Let players discover rather than be told.

      2. CONTEXTUAL NEED
         Character asks for help - reveals their situation
         Character sells items - reveals economy
         Character conflicts - reveals history
         Information emerges from interaction, not lecture.

      3. OPTIONAL DEPTH
         Codex entries for those who want them.
         Item descriptions (Dark Souls).
         Books in the world (Elder Scrolls).
         Players who care can seek; others skip.

      4. WATSON CHARACTERS
         New character who doesn't know.
         Player character as newcomer.
         Explanation is natural because recipient is genuinely ignorant.
         Still use sparingly.

      5. SHOW THE ARGUMENT
         Two NPCs disagree about history.
         Player witnesses debate.
         Information + character + conflict.
         "The king was just!" "The king was tyrant!"

      DISCO ELYSIUM APPROACH:
      Your own thoughts are characters.
      Lore comes from internal argument.
      You're learning about yourself AND the world.

      RULE: If you can cut the line and the player would
      still understand, cut it.
    symptoms:
      - Players skip NPC dialogue
      - Players can't remember lore despite extensive explanation
      - Dialogue options all lead to exposition
      - NPCs feel like info kiosks

  - id: writing-for-page-not-voice
    summary: Dialogue written to be read, not performed
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Writing dialogue as literature - complex sentences, formal structure,
      no contractions. Works in a novel. Sounds terrible when spoken. Voice
      actors struggle. Lines feel artificial.
    why: |
      Written English and spoken English are different languages. Novels can
      use "do not" - speech uses "don't." Novels can use semicolons - speech
      uses pauses. Writers who don't speak their lines produce dialogue that
      sounds written.

      Voice actors can salvage mediocre writing, but they can't fix writing
      that's fundamentally unperformable. And localization amplifies problems
      - if English is awkward, translations are worse.
    solution: |
      THE READ-ALOUD TEST:

      For every line:
      1. Say it out loud
      2. At performance speed
      3. With emotion intended
      4. Record yourself if needed

      If you stumble, rewrite.

      SPOKEN DIALOGUE RULES:

      1. CONTRACTIONS
         "I am going to the castle" -> "I'm heading to the castle"
         (Unless character is deliberately formal)

      2. SHORT SENTENCES
         Written: "I need you to understand that the situation has
                  become increasingly dangerous and we must act now."
         Spoken: "This is dangerous. We have to move. Now."

      3. BREATH POINTS
         Actors need to breathe.
         Commas, dashes, or sentence breaks.
         Don't write 40-word sentences.

      4. FRAGMENTS ARE NATURAL
         "Where?" "The castle." "Why?" "Long story."
         Real conversation is incomplete sentences.

      5. INTERRUPTION AND OVERLAP
         "--wait, you can't just--"
         "I know what you're going to say."
         People don't take turns perfectly.

      6. FILLER (sparingly)
         "Look, I..." "Well..." "The thing is..."
         Real speech has hesitation.
         But don't overdo it.

      VOICE DIRECTOR INVOLVEMENT:
      Bring VO director into writing process.
      They know what actors can do.
      They'll catch unperformable lines early.
    symptoms:
      - Voice actors request rewrites
      - Lines sound "off" even with good performance
      - Lip sync looks wrong (line longer than expected)
      - Players mention "wooden dialogue"

  - id: bark-repetition-fatigue
    summary: Combat and exploration barks becoming irritating through repetition
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Players hear the same bark dozens of times per session. "Hey, you,
      you're finally awake" becomes a meme. Combat callouts become fingernails
      on chalkboard. Players turn off voice audio.
    why: |
      Human perception notices repetition at lower thresholds than designers
      expect. 10 bark variants played randomly = noticeable repetition in 30
      minutes. True random often plays same line twice in a row. The "Skyrim
      guard" problem is almost universal.
    solution: |
      BARK SYSTEM DESIGN:

      1. VOLUME MATH
         High frequency context (combat hits): 15-20+ variants
         Medium frequency (exploration): 8-12 variants
         Low frequency (specific triggers): 4-6 variants

         Rule of thumb: frequency x 3 = minimum variants

      2. SHUFFLE, NOT RANDOM
         Don't pick randomly (can repeat).
         Remove played line from pool.
         Only return when pool exhausted.
         "I heard 10 different lines" vs "I heard the same 3."

      3. COOLDOWN TIMERS
         Line can't play for X seconds after playing.
         Even if triggered again.
         Player perception is short-term.

      4. CONTEXT AWARENESS
         Vary by: health, time of day, location, mood state.
         Same trigger, different context = different line.
         Expands pool without writing more.

      5. ESCALATION VARIANTS
         First combat: standard barks.
         Extended combat: fatigue barks ("How many more?").
         Near death: desperation barks.
         Victory: relief barks.
         Contextual variety feels intentional.

      6. SILENT GAPS
         Not every trigger needs voice.
         Some combat hits have no bark.
         Silence makes lines more impactful.
         Also: saves budget.

      HADES APPROACH:
      Context-specific lines feel written for the moment.
      "Oh, this room again" when you've died 50 times.
      Makes repetition feel intentional.
    symptoms:
      - Player memes about specific lines
      - Players turn off voice audio
      - Lines become irritating
      - Community complaints about repetition

  - id: unreliable-narrator-unscaffolded
    summary: Using unreliable narration without teaching players to doubt
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Deploying an unreliable narrator - memories that are wrong, a lying
      character, perception that can't be trusted - without first establishing
      that the narrative voice is fallible.
    why: |
      Players trust the game's presentation by default. Text is true. Cutscenes
      happened. If narration is unreliable without warning, 40%+ of players
      simply miss it. They feel confused instead of intrigued, then later feel
      cheated rather than cleverly misdirected.
    solution: |
      UNRELIABLE NARRATOR SCAFFOLDING:

      1. EARLY CALIBRATION
         First unreliability in low-stakes moment.
         Player catches the lie easily.
         Sets expectation: "This narrator can be wrong."

         Example: Narrator says "There were 50 enemies."
         Player fought 5. Player notices discrepancy.
         Seed planted.

      2. EXTERNAL CONTRADICTION
         Another character says something different.
         Environment shows different story.
         Player has triangulation option.
         "Wait, whose version is true?"

      3. MECHANICAL REINFORCEMENT
         Disco Elysium: Skills literally argue.
         Game explicitly shows conflicting internal sources.
         Player trained that even their own mind lies.

      4. ESCALATION
         Low-stakes discrepancy -> medium -> high.
         By major revelation, players are primed to question.
         The twist confirms what suspicious players expected.

      5. POST-REVEAL REPLAY VALUE
         Player wants to replay knowing truth.
         See what they missed.
         "Was that line always a lie?"
         New experience second time.

      PLAYER TYPES:
      - Suspicious players: catch early, feel smart at reveal.
      - Trusting players: surprised at reveal, want replay.
      - Neither: confused. Your scaffolding failed.

      SPEC OPS: THE LINE
      Escalates unreliability until you can't trust anything.
      By the end, players question what was real.
      Works because of careful building.
    symptoms:
      - Players ask "what actually happened?"
      - Confusion instead of intrigue
      - Players feel "cheated" by twist
      - Twist doesn't land emotionally

  - id: moral-choice-without-weight
    summary: Presenting moral choices that feel weightless
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Creating a moral choice where one option is obviously better, or where
      the consequences are too distant to feel, or where the framing reveals
      the "right" answer. Players choose without caring.
    why: |
      Real moral dilemmas are hard because they involve genuine trade-offs.
      "Do the right thing" isn't a dilemma. "The right thing costs you
      something you want" is a dilemma. Games often frame choices morally
      but make one option mechanically or narratively dominant.
    solution: |
      ADDING MORAL WEIGHT:

      1. MECHANICAL COST
         The "good" choice costs resources, power, or progress.
         Sparing the boss means no loot.
         Saving the village means missing the time-limited quest.
         Good should cost.

      2. RELATIONSHIP TRADE-OFFS
         Can't please everyone.
         NPC A approves of choice X.
         NPC B disapproves of choice X.
         No "everyone loves you" option.

      3. UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME
         Don't show the consequences in advance.
         Real choices are made with incomplete information.
         What seems right might have bad results.
         What seems wrong might work out.
         (Witcher 3 mastery)

      4. IDENTITY IMPLICATIONS
         Choice reflects who player IS.
         Not just "what happens" but "what kind of person does this."
         "You chose to sacrifice the few for the many."
         Consequences include self-definition.

      5. TIME PRESSURE
         Limit deliberation.
         Gut decisions reveal values.
         Can't optimize with calculation.

      6. AFTERMATH ACKNOWLEDGMENT
         NPCs remember.
         World reflects choice.
         Game doesn't let you forget.

      BAD: "Save the orphan or save the gold"
      GOOD: "Save the orphan (lose mission) or save the mission (orphan dies)"
            And either way, someone you like is disappointed.
    symptoms:
      - 90%+ of players choose same option
      - Guides recommend one option
      - Players don't agonize over choices
      - Choices feel pro forma

  - id: localization-afterthought
    summary: Writing English dialogue that doesn't translate
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Writing dialogue with puns, idioms, cultural references, or variable-
      length elements that localization teams can't reasonably translate.
      Also: not accounting for text expansion (German is ~30% longer than
      English) in UI and voice timing.
    why: |
      Games ship internationally. Localization is not a nice-to-have but a
      market requirement. Dialogue written without localization in mind
      creates massive costs: rewrites, re-records, compromised quality in
      other languages. Non-English versions feel inferior.
    solution: |
      LOCALIZATION-AWARE WRITING:

      1. AVOID PUNS (or flag them)
         "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana."
         This cannot be translated.
         Flag for "creative adaptation" if essential.

      2. AVOID IDIOMS (or explain intent)
         "It's raining cats and dogs" means nothing in most languages.
         Write intent note: "(heavy rain)"
         Translators can find equivalent idiom.

      3. ACCOUNT FOR EXPANSION
         German: +30% text length
         Spanish: +20%
         Japanese: variable (can be shorter!)
         Design UI for longest language.

      4. SEPARATE EMOTIONAL BEATS
         "I love you, but we can't be together."
         Two beats. Translatable separately.
         Don't make meaning depend on word order.

      5. AVOID GENDERED ASSUMPTIONS
         "He or she" constructs vary by language.
         Some languages have no neutral pronouns.
         Plan for grammatical gender.

      6. VOICE SYNC CONSIDERATIONS
         Recorded audio must match lip sync.
         Longer translations = timing problems.
         Budget for per-language recordings.
         Or design for overdubbable moments.

      7. LOCALIZATION CONTEXT NOTES
         Include notes for translators:
         - Who is speaking
         - What emotion
         - What they mean (not just what they say)
         - Any wordplay to adapt

      SPREADSHEET FORMAT:
      | ID | English | Context | Notes |
      | DLG_001 | "I'm not your friend." | Angry, betrayed | Emphasis on NOT |
    symptoms:

      - Non-English versions feel different
      - UI text gets cut off in other languages

  - id: quest-without-motivation
    summary: Objectives that tell WHAT but not WHY
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Quest objectives that are purely mechanical ("Kill 5 wolves") without
      integrating player motivation. Player knows task but doesn't care about
      outcome. Quests feel like chores on a checklist.
    why: |
      Quests are the contract between designer and player. If the quest doesn't
      answer "why should I care?", players do it for XP, not for story. The
      quest system becomes a skinner box, not a narrative driver. Worse: it
      trains players to skip dialogue and just do objectives.
    solution: |
      QUEST MOTIVATION FRAMEWORK:

      1. CAUSAL CHAIN
         Why this quest? What caused it?
         Not: "Kill wolves"
         But: "Wolves ate the courier. Find what he was carrying."
         Task same. Motivation different.

      2. STAKES EMBEDDING
         What happens if player doesn't do this?
         Make failure (theoretically) possible.
         "The merchant's family starves without this delivery."
         (Even if failure isn't mechanically possible)

      3. PERSONAL CONNECTION
         Link quest to character player has met.
         "Help Mira's sister" beats "Help unnamed NPC."
         Relationship creates investment.

      4. MYSTERY ELEMENT
         Incomplete information creates curiosity.
         "Something is killing travelers on the road."
         Player wants to know what.

      5. EVOLVING OBJECTIVES
         Quest changes as player learns.
         "Find the missing person"
         -> "The missing person was a spy"
         -> "Decide what to do with what they knew"

      6. WORLD-STATE INTEGRATION
         Quest changes the world visibly.
         Town is different after quest.
         Not just quest log cleared.

      THE WITCHER APPROACH:
      Every quest is a story.
      Even "kill monster" quests have twist.
      Player never knows if it's straightforward.
    symptoms:
      - Players skip quest dialogue
      - Players follow markers without understanding why
      - Quests feel like checkbox clearing
      - Players don't remember quest stories

  - id: emotional-beat-without-earn
    summary: Asking for emotion the story hasn't built
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      A character death meant to be devastating, but player barely knew them.
      A reunion meant to be joyful, but separation was too short. A betrayal
      meant to shock, but antagonist was obviously suspicious.
    why: |
      Emotional payoff requires emotional investment. Games often shortcut
      the earning process - "this character is important" by telling rather
      than showing. Players intellectually understand "I should be sad" but
      don't feel it. The moment falls flat.
    solution: |
      EARNING EMOTIONAL BEATS:

      1. TIME INVESTMENT
         Players must spend time with character.
         Not just cutscenes - gameplay time.
         Companion through 5 hours of play = different than
         companion in one cutscene.

      2. ACTIVE RELATIONSHIP
         Player makes choices about relationship.
         Dialogue options, help given, time spent.
         Investment creates attachment.

      3. DEMONSTRATION, NOT DECLARATION
         Don't tell player "this character matters."
         Show character being helpful, funny, interesting.
         Let player decide they care.

      4. VULNERABILITY SHARING
         Character shares weakness with player.
         Player knows something private.
         Creates intimacy.

      5. MUTUAL DEPENDENCE
         Character helps player in gameplay.
         Player protects character.
         Mechanical relationship supports emotional one.

      HADES MASTERY:
      You see characters EVERY DEATH.
      Hundreds of small interactions.
      By hour 20, you care about everyone.
      Their arcs feel earned.

      RULE OF THUMB:
      Player should be able to describe why they care
      about a character before emotional beat lands.
      If they can't, it hasn't been earned.
    symptoms:
      - "Who was that?" reactions to death scenes
      - Players unmoved by intended emotional beats
      - Comparisons to "character we barely knew"
      - Emotional moments become memes

  - id: procedural-without-expression
    summary: Emergent narrative with no way for player to perceive it
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Building complex simulations where NPCs have relationships, memory,
      and goals - but none of this is communicated to the player. The
      interesting story is happening in the code, invisible to the user.
    why: |
      A story the player doesn't perceive isn't a story. Dwarf Fortress is
      opaque; its emergent narratives require player interpretation of
      sparse data. More accessible games need to surface emergence explicitly.
      Otherwise, the sophisticated system creates nothing the player experiences.
    solution: |
      EMERGENCE EXPRESSION METHODS:

      1. DIALOGUE VARIATION
         NPCs reference past events.
         "After what you did to my brother..."
         State made visible through character speech.

      2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES
         NPCs act differently based on state.
         Fearful NPCs flinch.
         Angry NPCs are curt.
         Observable behavior tells story.

      3. WORLD STATE CHANGES
         Environment reflects history.
         Burned village stays burned.
         Cemetery grows with deaths.
         Space as narrative record.

      4. NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS
         "So-and-so has changed their opinion of you."
         Explicit surfacing of state change.
         Can feel gamey but works.

      5. REPUTATION/RELATIONSHIP UI
         Visual display of standings.
         Player can see web of relations.
         Makes invisible visible.

      6. GOSSIP SYSTEMS
         NPCs talk about each other.
         Player learns about world through NPC perspective.
         "Did you hear what happened in Rivertown?"

      RIMWORLD APPROACH:
      Event logs narrate emergent story.
      "Randy sent a raid." "Colonist A and B fell in love."
      Player reads their world's story.

      CRUSADER KINGS APPROACH:
      Characters have opinions, traits, memories.
      All visible to player.
      Player can SEE the emergent story.
    symptoms:
      - Players don't notice NPC systems
      - Simulation feels random, not causal
      - Cool systems, unperceived by players
      - "I didn't know that was happening"

  - id: silent-protagonist-without-reason
    summary: Mute player character without intentional design
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Player character never speaks, not as deliberate design choice but
      because voice acting is expensive or writer didn't consider it.
      Creates awkward conversations where NPCs monologue at silent player.
    why: |
      Silent protagonists can work brilliantly (Link, Gordon Freeman) but
      require intentional design. NPCs must be written to carry conversations
      solo. World must account for silent protagonist. Without intention,
      it's just awkward - especially in voiced games where everyone else speaks.
    solution: |
      IF SILENT, DESIGN FOR IT:

      1. NPCs CARRY CONVERSATION
         Questions are rhetorical or yes/no.
         NPCs provide both sides of dialogue.
         "I bet you're wondering about X. Well..."
         Requires intentional writing style.

      2. PHYSICAL EXPRESSION
         Protagonist nods, shakes head, gestures.
         Reaction shows even without voice.
         Camera catches player response.

      3. WORLD ACKNOWLEDGES SILENCE
         Characters notice protagonist is quiet.
         "You're not much of a talker, are you?"
         Makes it diegetic.

      4. TEXT OPTIONS WITHOUT VOICE
         Player selects text response.
         Voice actor doesn't say it.
         But player's choice is expressed.
         (Older RPG approach)

      5. IF VOICED, COMMIT
         Budget for player voice.
         Player character is a character.
         Has personality, opinions, reactions.
         Works if player accepts they're playing defined character.

      HALF-LIFE:
      Gordon Freeman never speaks.
      NPCs are written to carry scenes.
      Physical comedy substitutes for dialogue.
      Intentional silence = effective silence.

      SKYRIM:
      Player character is silent during dialogue
      but grunts in combat.
      Feels arbitrary, not intentional.
    symptoms:
      - Scenes feel like NPCs talking to themselves
      - Player character seems disconnected
      - Tonal mismatch when everyone else is voiced
      - Awkward pauses where response expected
