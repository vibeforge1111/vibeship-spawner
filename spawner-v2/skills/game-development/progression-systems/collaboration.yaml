receives_context_from:
  - skill: game-design-core
    relationship: "Primary"
    description: |
      Game Design Core establishes the fundamental loop. Progression Systems
      builds reward and growth mechanics on top of that foundation.

    receives:
      - name: "Core Loop Definition"
        description: "The fundamental gameplay loop (action → feedback → motivation)"

        example: "Kill enemies → Get loot → Get stronger → Kill harder enemies"

      - name: "Target Session Length"
        description: "How long a typical play session should be"
        required: true
        example: "30-60 minutes casual, 2-4 hours dedicated"

      - name: "Player Motivation Profile"
        description: "What motivates the target player (achievement, exploration, social, etc.)"
        required: false

    handoff_protocol: |
      When receiving from game-design-core:
      1. CONFIRM you have the core loop definition
      2. VALIDATE session length expectations are clear
      3. ASK about player motivation if not provided
      4. DESIGN progression layers that reinforce (not fight) the core loop

  - skill: game-monetization
    relationship: "Collaborative"
    description: |
      Monetization defines what can be sold. Progression must create value
      without creating pay-to-win or frustration.

    receives:
      - name: "Monetization Model"
        description: "Premium, F2P, battle pass, cosmetic-only, etc."
        required: true
        example: "F2P with cosmetic battle pass"

      - name: "F2P Parity Requirements"
        description: "What F2P players must be able to achieve"

        example: "All gameplay content achievable, cosmetics optional"

    handoff_protocol: |
      When receiving from game-monetization:
      1. UNDERSTAND the monetization model completely
      2. DESIGN F2P progression first - it must feel complete
      3. ADD paid acceleration as optional layer, never required
      4. ENSURE no content is gated behind payment
      5. VALIDATE with spawner_validate for ethical monetization patterns

  - skill: narrative-design
    relationship: "Supportive"
    description: |
      Narrative provides story beats. Progression must pace mechanical
      growth to match narrative moments.

    receives:
      - name: "Story Beat Timeline"
        description: "When major narrative moments occur"
        required: false

      When receiving from narrative-design:
      1. MAP story beats to progression milestones
      2. ENSURE power fantasy aligns with narrative arc
      3. GATE abilities appropriately for story requirements
      4. COMMUNICATE progression limitations back to narrative

  - skill: game-balance
    relationship: "Bidirectional"
    description: |
      Balance defines difficulty. Progression defines player power.
      These must be designed in tandem.

    receives:
      - name: "Difficulty Curve"
        description: "How challenge should scale across the game"
        required: true
        example: "Gradual ramp, difficulty spikes at bosses"

        required: false
        example: "High skill can beat content 20% underleveled"

    handoff_protocol: |
      When receiving from game-balance:
      1. ALIGN progression milestones with content power requirements
      2. DESIGN catch-up mechanics to prevent permanent undergearing
      3. CREATE power breakpoints that enable skill expression
      4. SHARE power budget assumptions back to balance team

  - skill: game-analytics
    relationship: "Feedback Loop"
    description: |
      Analytics provides data on actual player behavior.
      Progression uses this to tune and iterate.

    receives:
      - name: "Progression Funnel Data"
        description: "Where players are dropping off in progression"
        required: false
        example: "40% quit at level 15, 25% at level 30"

      - name: "Session Length Data"
        description: "Actual play session durations"
        required: false
        example: "Average 45 min, median 30 min"

      - name: "Reward Engagement Metrics"
        description: "Which rewards drive engagement vs. ignored"
        required: false
        example: "Legendary drops spike session time 2x"

    handoff_protocol: |
      When receiving from game-analytics:
      1. IDENTIFY the specific progression pain points
      2. PROPOSE targeted fixes (not global rebalancing)
      3. CREATE A/B test variants if appropriate
      4. SET UP tracking for new progression elements

# ============================================
# CONFLICT RESOLUTION
# ============================================

conflict_resolution:
  - scenario: "Monetization wants faster paid progression"
    resolution: |
      Progression Systems has VETO on paid acceleration that:
      1. Exceeds 2x speed over F2P baseline
      2. Gates any content behind payment
      3. Creates power advantages in competitive modes

      Compromise: Cosmetic battle pass, convenience (inventory), XP boosts

  - scenario: "Balance wants harder content, Narrative wants faster story"
    resolution: |
      Progression Systems mediates by:
      1. Creating optional difficulty modes
      2. Separating story progression from power progression
      3. Adding skill-based shortcuts for skilled players

  - scenario: "Analytics shows players quitting at level 15"
    resolution: |
      Progression Systems investigates:
      1. Is level 15 a progression wall? → Adjust curve
      2. Is level 15 content boring? → Handoff to game-design-core
      3. Is level 15 too hard? → Handoff to game-balance
