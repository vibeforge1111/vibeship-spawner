    title: "RGB Colors Die in CMYK Conversion"
    severity: critical
    category: color-management
    description: |
      RGB's color gamut is significantly larger than CMYK's. Colors that look vibrant
      on screen - especially neon greens, electric blues, hot pinks, and saturated
      oranges - will shift dramatically when converted. That gorgeous teal becomes
      a dull aqua. Your neon green turns olive. There's no going back once printed.
    symptoms:
      - "My colors look completely different in print"
      - "The bright colors all look muddy"
      - "Why does my purple look brown?"
    detection: |
      In Photoshop/Illustrator: View > Proof Colors (Ctrl/Cmd+Y)
      Enable View > Gamut Warning to see out-of-gamut colors
      Any flagged colors WILL shift in print
    solution: |
      1. Start every project in CMYK mode
      2. If you have RGB assets, convert them FIRST before designing around them
      3. Use Proof Colors mode while designing to see actual print colors
      4. For critical colors (logos), use Pantone spot colors
      5. Never flip-flop between modes - each conversion degrades colors
    affected_colors:
      - "Neon/fluorescent anything - doesn't exist in CMYK"
      - "Electric blue (RGB 0,0,255) - becomes purple-ish"
      - "Pure red (RGB 255,0,0) - loses intensity"
      - "Lime green - shifts toward olive"
      - "Hot pink/magenta - loses vibrancy"

  - id: no-bleed-white-edges
    title: "Missing Bleed = White Edges on Everything"
    severity: critical
    category: file-preparation
    description: |
      Die-cutting machines have ±1mm tolerance. If your artwork stops exactly at
      the trim line, any cutting variance shows as white edges. This is the #1
      tell of amateur production. Once printed, it cannot be fixed.
    symptoms:
      - "Random white lines on edges of cards/boxes"
      - "Some edges fine, others have white showing"
      - "Looks great on screen but terrible in print"
    detection: |
      Open files in Illustrator/InDesign and check:
      - Is there a bleed area defined?
      - Does artwork extend to bleed boundary?
      - Are there any elements that stop at trim line?

      Quick test: Turn on trim marks preview - if any color touches
      the trim line exactly, you need to extend it.
    solution: |
      1. Standard bleed: 3mm (0.125") all edges
      2. Game boards: 10mm bleed for fold-over edges
      3. EVERY edge-touching element must extend to bleed
      4. Use manufacturer templates (they include bleed guides)
      5. Verify bleed on every file before submission

    title: "K100 Black Looks Gray in Print"
    severity: critical
    category: color-management
    description: |
      Using 100% black (K only, no CMY) for large areas results in a washed-out,
      grayish appearance. The single-ink coverage is insufficient for deep blacks.
      Your "black" box sitting next to a competitor's rich black box will look
      cheap and faded.
    symptoms:
      - "My black backgrounds look gray"
      - "Black areas look washed out"
      - "Blacks look different in different areas"
    detection: |
      Select black areas and check color values:
      - C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100 = PROBLEM
      - Should be: C=60, M=40, Y=40, K=100 (or similar)

      Exception: Small black text should be K100 only for registration.
    solution: |
      Use rich black for large areas:
      - Standard: C60-M40-Y40-K100 (neutral)
      - Warm: C40-M60-Y60-K100 (reddish undertone)
      - Cool: C80-M60-Y40-K100 (bluish undertone)

      Keep K100 ONLY for:
      - Body text under 12pt
      - Fine lines and details
      - Barcodes

  - id: die-cut-drift
    title: "Die-Cutting Drifts ±1mm From Center"
    severity: critical
    category: manufacturing
    description: |
      Die-cutting machines have inherent tolerance. Cards may be cut slightly off-center.
      Intricate designs near edges will show this drift obviously, potentially creating
      "marked cards" where edge patterns differ between cards.
    symptoms:
      - "Card borders are uneven"
      - "Some cards have wider margins on one side"
      - "Pattern near edge looks different on different cards"
    detection: |
      Review card designs for:
      - Intricate patterns within 3mm of edges
      - Thin borders that would show variance
      - Asymmetrical edge elements
    solution: |
      1. Keep safe zone 4-5mm from cut line
      2. Use symmetrical/centered designs
      3. Avoid thin borders (3mm+ if borders needed)
      4. No intricate patterns near edges
      5. For punchboards: 6mm between die lines minimum

  - id: font-too-small
    title: "Small Fonts Become Unreadable Smudges"
    severity: high
    category: typography
    description: |
      Fonts below 6pt lose detail in offset printing. Serifs disappear, letters merge,
      and text becomes illegible. Players shouldn't need magnifying glasses. This is
      especially problematic for game text that players reference during play.
    symptoms:
      - "Can't read the small text on cards"
      - "Text looks blurry"
      - "Letters are running together"
    detection: |
      Search for text smaller than 6pt in design files.
      Print a test page at actual size and read from arm's length.
      Check reversed text (light on dark) - needs to be even larger.
    solution: |
      Minimum sizes:
      - Body text: 8pt
      - Secondary text: 7pt
      - Fine print: 6pt (absolute minimum)
      - Reversed text: 7pt+ (adds 1pt to requirements)

      Font choice:
      - Sans-serif fonts stay legible at smaller sizes
      - Avoid thin/light weights for small text
      - Higher x-height fonts are more legible

  - id: registration-error
    title: "Multi-Color Registration Shifts Create Blur"
    severity: high
    category: printing
    description: |
      Each CMYK plate prints separately with ±0.3mm alignment tolerance. Fine details
      that rely on multiple colors aligning perfectly will show color fringing.
      Small text in colors other than pure K100 may appear blurry.
    symptoms:
      - "Colored text looks blurry"
      - "See color halos around elements"
      - "Fine lines have colored edges"
    detection: |
      Look for:
      - Small text in CMYK colors (not K100)
      - Thin lines in rich black or colors
      - Fine details requiring multiple color plates
    solution: |
      For small text and fine lines:
      - Use pure K100 (single plate, no registration needed)
      - Minimum 0.5pt line thickness for multi-color
      - Avoid fine serifs in colored text
      - Use trapping for overlapping color areas

  - id: humidity-warp
    title: "Boxes and Boards Warp From Humidity Changes"
    severity: high
    category: manufacturing
    description: |
      Paper products absorb moisture. Games manufactured in high-humidity environments
      (China coast) and shipped to dry climates (Arizona) will warp as they acclimate.
      Coated paper expands/contracts differently than cardboard core, causing curl.
    symptoms:
      - "Box lid doesn't close flat"
      - "Game board has a curve to it"
      - "Components arrived warped"
    detection: |
      Check storage conditions:
      - Humidity difference between manufacture and destination?
      - Games stored in garage/basement?
      - Shipping container sat in heat?
    solution: |
      Prevention:
      - Store at 45-50% relative humidity, 65-75°F
      - Use desiccant packets in boxes (silica gel)
      - Allow games to acclimate before playing
      - Store vertically to prevent stacking warp

      Recovery:
      - Place warped items under heavy, flat weight
      - Use dehumidifier in storage area
      - May require manufacturer claim for severe cases
    manufacturer_note: |
      Some warp is normal during transit and will settle after
      1-2 weeks in stable conditions. Severe warp (>5mm curl)
      is a manufacturing defect.

  - id: component-fit-tolerance
    title: "Components Don't Fit in Insert"
    severity: high
    category: insert-design
    description: |
      Designers often create compartments exactly to component size. But cards expand
      when sleeved, components have manufacturing tolerance, and tight fits frustrate
      players. Nothing ruins an unboxing like components that won't go back in the box.
    symptoms:
      - "Sleeved cards don't fit"
      - "Have to force components into slots"
      - "Components fall out when tilting box"
    detection: |
      Measure compartments vs components:
      - Cards sleeved? (+5mm needed)
      - Components touching all walls? (too tight)
      - Finger room for removal? (often forgotten)
    solution: |
      Required clearances:
      - Unsleeved cards: +2mm width, +3mm height
      - Sleeved cards: +5mm width, +5mm height
      - Tokens/tiles: +3mm per dimension
      - Dice: +2mm per dimension
      - Meeples: +3mm per dimension
      - Miniatures: +5mm all around

      Include finger notches for all compartments.
      Test with actual sleeved components.

  - id: proof-color-inaccuracy
    title: "Screen Proofs Don't Match Print"
    severity: high
    category: proofing
    description: |
      Digital proofs on screens are inherently inaccurate. Monitor calibration varies,
      ambient lighting affects perception, and CMYK simulation on RGB screens is
      approximate at best. Approving based on screen proofs leads to surprises.
    symptoms:
      - "Print looks different than the PDF"
      - "Colors approved on screen look wrong in print"
      - "My calibrated monitor still didn't match"
    detection: |
      You approved proofs only via:
      - Email PDFs
      - Screen mockups
      - Digital renders
    solution: |
      1. Always request physical proofs
      2. View proofs in neutral daylight (D50/5000K)
      3. Compare proofs side-by-side with intent
      4. Build proof costs into project budget ($100-300)
      5. For critical colors, use Pantone and verify with swatch book

  - id: wrong-icc-profile
    title: "Wrong ICC Profile = Wrong Colors"
    severity: medium
    category: color-management
    description: |
      Different printing conditions require different color profiles. Using US Web
      Coated SWOP for a European printer using FOGRA39 will shift all colors. Your
      proofing becomes meaningless if the profile doesn't match the press.
    symptoms:
      - "Colors shift between proofs and production"
      - "Colors look different than other jobs"
      - "Printer says my files are in wrong color space"
    detection: |
      Check file's embedded profile:
      - Illustrator: Document Color Mode in document info
      - Photoshop: Image > Mode and Edit > Color Settings
    solution: |
      Ask manufacturer for their required ICC profile:
      - US printers: Usually US Web Coated (SWOP) v2
      - EU printers: Usually Coated FOGRA39 (ISO 12647-2:2004)
      - Asia: Varies - always confirm

      Convert files to required profile before submission.
      Use Relative Colorimetric rendering intent.

  - id: unoptimized-nesting
    title: "Wasted Money on Suboptimal Sheet Layout"
    severity: medium
    category: cost-optimization
    description: |
      Print sheets have fixed sizes. A deck of 70 cards uses 2 sheets (same as 108
      cards). Custom token shapes waste punchboard space. Without optimization,
      you're paying for material you don't use.
    symptoms:
      - "Quote seems high for component count"
      - "Manufacturer mentions 'partially filled sheets'"
      - "Multiple die shapes for similar tokens"
    detection: |
      Check your component counts against sheet multiples:
      - Cards: 54 per sheet (typical)
      - Tokens: Varies by size

      Are your token shapes optimizable to rectangles?
    solution: |
      Cards:
      - Optimal counts: 54, 108, 162 (sheet multiples)
      - 55 cards = 2 sheets (same as 108)
      - If you have 60 cards, add 48 more content or cut to 54

      Punchboards:
      - Rectangular tokens nest efficiently
      - Custom shapes need custom dies ($200-500 each)
      - Share die patterns across similar tokens
      - Combine small punchboards on larger sheets

      Ask manufacturer for sheet layouts before finalizing design.

  - id: foil-stamp-limitations
    title: "Foil Stamping Can't Do Gradients"
    severity: medium
    category: finishing
    description: |
      Foil stamping uses a solid metal die. It's binary - foil or no foil. Gradients,
      halftones, and fine details don't work. Trying to approximate gradients with
      small patterns often fails at small sizes.
    symptoms:
      - "My gradient foil looks like steps"
      - "Fine foil details are lost"
      - "Halftone pattern didn't foil properly"
    detection: |
      Review foil artwork for:
      - Gradients or fades
      - Halftone/screened areas
      - Details smaller than 0.5mm
    solution: |
      Foil stamping requirements:
      - Solid areas only (no gradients)
      - Minimum detail: 0.25-0.5mm
      - Maximum coverage: ~30% of surface
      - Simple, bold designs work best

      If you need gradients:
      - Use spot UV (can do gradients)
      - Use metallic ink (can do gradients)
      - Simplify to solid foil areas

  - id: spot-uv-matte-only
    title: "Spot UV Invisible on Gloss Lamination"
    severity: medium
    category: finishing
    description: |
      Spot UV creates contrast by being shiny on a less-shiny surface. On gloss
      lamination, the difference is minimal. You're paying for an effect that's
      barely visible.
    symptoms:
      - "Can barely see the spot UV"
      - "Expected more contrast in the finish"
      - "Wasted money on premium finish"
    detection: |
      Check lamination specified with spot UV:
      - Gloss + Spot UV = poor contrast
      - Matte + Spot UV = excellent contrast
      - Soft-touch + Spot UV = premium contrast
    solution: |
      Pair spot UV with matte or soft-touch lamination.
      The contrast ratio is what creates the premium effect.
      Budget for matte base when planning spot UV.

    title: "Light Reveals Card Content (Blue Core)"
    severity: medium
    category: materials
    description: |
      Blue core card stock, while industry standard, allows some light transmission.
      Hold a card up to a bright light and you might see the back through the front.
      For hidden information games, this is a playability issue.
    symptoms:
      - "Can see faint image through cards in sunlight"
      - "Some players can identify cards from light angle"
      - "Noticed in photography for Kickstarter"
    detection: |
      Hold prototype cards up to bright light.
      Can you see any hint of the back design?
      Is this a hidden-information game?
    solution: |
      For hidden information games:
      - Upgrade to black core card stock
      - Adds 15-20% to card cost
      - Worth it for competitive/casino-style games

      Acceptable for blue core:
      - Tableau building games
      - Games with no hidden hands
      - Prototype/budget editions

  - id: punchboard-tearout
    title: "Punchboard Tokens Tear When Removing"
    severity: medium
    category: manufacturing
    description: |
      Poor die-cut specifications can leave tokens stuck or cause paper tearout when
      removing. The thin bridges between token and board must be strong enough to
      hold during shipping but weak enough for clean removal.
    symptoms:
      - "Tokens won't pop out cleanly"
      - "Paper layer tears off tokens"
      - "Some tokens completely stuck"
    detection: |
      Prototype shows:
      - Excessive force needed for removal
      - Visible paper damage after punching
      - Inconsistent punching experience
    solution: |
      Punchboard specifications:
      - Bridge points: Usually 2-4 per token
      - Bridge size: 0.5-1mm wide
      - Token edge: 0.5mm kiss-cut depth

      Communicate with manufacturer about:
      - Card stock weight
      - Expected removal force
      - Bridge point placement

    description: |
      Weak magnets or poor placement causes premium magnetic boxes to open during
      shipping and handling. The satisfying "click" becomes a frustrating flop.
    symptoms:
      - "Lid keeps falling open"
      - "Box opens during transport"
      - "Magnet seems to have lost strength"
    detection: |
      Test magnetic strength:
      - Hold box vertical by lid - does it stay closed?
      - Shake box moderately - does lid pop?
      - Compare to known good magnetic boxes
    solution: |
      Specify:
      - Magnet grade: N35 minimum (N45 for heavy lids)
      - Magnet count: 4 standard (2 lid, 2 base)
      - Alignment: Magnets must face each other precisely

      Consider weight:
      - Heavy lids need stronger magnets
      - Deep lids may need 6 magnets (3+3)
      - Test prototype before mass production

    description: |
      Paper belly bands (shrink wrap replacement) can slide or tear during handling.
      They're more eco-friendly but less secure than shrink wrap.
    symptoms:
      - "Belly band bunched up on one end"
      - "Belly band torn during shipping"
      - "Band came off in transit"
    detection: |
      Visual inspection of packaged games.
      Test handling/dropping with belly band.
    solution: |
      - Tighter fit (1-2mm smaller than box perimeter)
      - Glue dot to secure band to box
      - Consider paper wrap instead of band
      - Accept some band movement for eco benefits

      Fresh linen-finished cards with heavy ink coverage may show some ink transfer
      when rubbed. This settles with use and UV coating helps, but can alarm
      first-time users.
    symptoms:
      - "Ink smudges on fingers from new cards"
      - "Cards seem to leave residue"
      - "First few shuffles show ink marks"
    detection: |
      Rub thumb firmly across heavy-ink areas of new cards.
      Check for color transfer.
    solution: |
      - UV coating reduces ink rub-off
      - Issue diminishes after first few uses
      - Avoid 100% ink coverage on both faces
      - Consider varnish for heavy-ink designs

      - "Components shifted during shipping"
      - "Unboxing reveals jumbled contents"
    detection: |
      Shake fully loaded box.
      Store vertically for 24 hours and check.
    solution: |
      - Snugger compartment fit (+2mm not +5mm where appropriate)
      - Foam padding in unused space
      - Cardboard shims above inserts
      - Include small slip noting "Contents may shift"

      Ground shipping containers in summer can exceed 140°F/60°C.
      This can:
      - Soften certain adhesives
      - Accelerate ink curing/cracking
      - Cause wax-coated surfaces to transfer

      Ship temperature-sensitive products via climate-controlled freight
      or avoid July-August ground shipping to hot regions.
