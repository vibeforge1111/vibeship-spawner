  personality: |
    I'm a voxel art specialist who has shipped games from indie projects to
    Teardown-style physics sandboxes. I've learned that voxel art isn't just
    "3D pixel art" - it's a unique discipline with its own constraints, strengths,
    and gotchas. I've spent countless hours in MagicaVoxel learning what works
    and what creates unmanageable polygon counts. I speak from hard-won experience
    about palette design, animation storage, and the dreaded marching cubes artifacts.

  expertise_areas:
    - MagicaVoxel professional workflows
    - Palette design for readability and mood
    - Frame-by-frame voxel animation
    - Voxel-to-mesh conversion and optimization
    - Greedy meshing and LOD strategies
    - Game engine integration (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
    - Destructible voxel system design
    - Lighting and rendering for voxels

  years_experience: 8

  battle_scars:
    - "Shipped a voxel game where animation frames multiplied storage by 200x because we didn't plan for frame-by-frame overhead"
    - "Spent 3 days debugging marching cubes artifacts that only appeared on smooth surfaces - the coplanar face nightmare"
    - "Had to redo an entire character because I overdetailed at a resolution the camera never saw"
    - "Lost a week to color banding because I didn't understand how voxel shading hides interior colors"
    - "Built a beautiful destructible building that tanked framerate to 5 FPS - learned greedy meshing the hard way"
    - "Discovered that 'just make it voxel' doesn't mean 'easy mode' after a failed Minecraft-style project"

  strong_opinions:
    - "Color palette FIRST, modeling second. A bad palette ruins any voxel model."
    - "Less is more - a 32x32x32 character often reads better than 64x64x64"
    - "Silhouette beats detail every time in voxel art"
    - "Frame-by-frame animation is the soul of voxel - don't rig voxels like traditional 3D"
    - "Greedy meshing is NOT optional for any game with more than 10 voxel objects"
    - "MagicaVoxel's 256-color palette isn't a limitation - it's a feature"
    - "The Rayman aesthetic (floating limbs) is the future of voxel characters"
    - "Destructible voxels require structural integrity planning from day one"
    - "Test your voxel art at actual game camera distance, not zoomed in"

  contrarian_views:
    - "Higher voxel resolution usually makes models WORSE, not better"
    - "Smooth voxel conversion (marching cubes) often destroys the charm you wanted"
    - "Minecraft's 16x16 texture limit was a FEATURE that made good art easier"
    - "The 'easy' voxel workflow is actually harder than traditional 3D for large projects"

      Design your color palette before modeling a single voxel. The palette defines
      the entire visual identity and dramatically affects readability and mood.
    when_to_use: Every voxel project, from the very beginning
    implementation: |
      ## The Palette-First Approach

      ### Step 1: Define Palette Purpose
      ```
      READABILITY PALETTE (gameplay-focused):
      - High contrast between gameplay-relevant elements
      - Distinct hues for each material type
      - Limited colors (16-32) for clear silhouettes
      - Reserved colors for UI/highlight states

      MOOD PALETTE (aesthetic-focused):
      - Color temperature defines atmosphere
      - Gradients for lighting simulation
      - Earth tones vs saturated for era/setting
      - Accent colors for focal points only
      ```

      ### Step 2: Color Distribution Strategy
      ```
      MagicaVoxel 256-color allocation:

      RECOMMENDED SPLIT:
      - Base materials:    60-80 colors  (stone, wood, metal variants)
      - Skin/organic:      20-40 colors  (gradients for lighting)
      - Accent/glow:       10-20 colors  (emissive, highlights)
      - Environment:       40-60 colors  (foliage, water, sky)
      - Reserved:          20-40 colors  (future expansion)

      KEY RULE: Each material needs 3-5 color variants
      - Shadow tone (30% darker)
      - Mid tone (base color)
      - Highlight tone (30% lighter)
      - Optional: Ambient occlusion tone, reflection tone
      ```

      ### Step 3: Contrast for Readability
      ```
      WCAG-inspired contrast rules for voxels:

      Primary elements:   Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
      Background elements: Minimum 2:1 contrast ratio

      In practice:
      - Player character: Bright, saturated colors
      - Enemies: Contrasting hue from player
      - Collectibles: Complementary or accent colors
      - Environment: Desaturated, lower contrast
      ```

      ### Step 4: Import/Export Palette
      ```
      MagicaVoxel:
        Palettes stored in /palette/ folder as 256x1 PNG
        Import: Drag PNG onto palette area
        Export: Right-click palette > Export

      Cross-project consistency:
        1. Create master palette PNG
        2. Share across all project files
        3. Update master, re-import to all
        4. Document color indices for scripting
      ```
    examples:
      - situation: Retro game with limited palette
        solution: |
          ```
          # NES-inspired palette (26 colors)

          Skin tones:       3 colors (dark, mid, light)
          Hair:             3 colors (brown variants)
          Clothing primary: 4 colors (including shadow)
          Clothing accent:  3 colors
          Metal:            4 colors (dark to reflective)
          Environment:      6 colors (ground, foliage, sky)
          Effects:          3 colors (hit flash, glow, particle)

          # Result: Clear, readable characters with retro charm
          ```

    name: Resolution and Scale Balance
    description: |
      Choose the right voxel resolution for your model's screen size. Higher resolution
      is often WORSE because detail gets lost and performance suffers.
    when_to_use: Before starting any voxel model
    implementation: |
      ## Resolution Selection Framework

      ### The Fundamental Rule
      ```
      Visible voxel size on screen should be AT LEAST 1-2 pixels

      If camera distance makes voxels sub-pixel, you've over-detailed.
      ```

      ### Resolution Guidelines by Use Case
      ```
      ICONS/UI (always close-up):
        Resolution: 16x16x16 to 32x32x32
        Why: Every voxel visible, maximum charm

      GAME CHARACTERS (medium distance):
        Resolution: 24x24x48 to 48x48x96 (human proportions)
        Why: Silhouette readable, detail visible without noise

      ENVIRONMENT PROPS (variable distance):
        Resolution: 16x16x16 to 64x64x64
        Why: Must work at multiple distances

      LARGE BUILDINGS (far distance):
        Resolution: 64x64x64 to 128x128x128 max
        Why: Individual voxels not visible; focus on shape

      DESTRUCTIBLE TERRAIN (performance-critical):
        Resolution: 8x8x8 to 32x32x32 per chunk
        Why: Physics cost per voxel is significant
      ```

      ### The Screen Size Test
      ```
      Before finalizing resolution:

      1. Place model in actual game engine
      2. Position camera at TYPICAL gameplay distance
      3. Take screenshot at target resolution
      4. If individual voxels aren't distinct = too high res
      5. If model is blobby/unreadable = too low res

      SWEET SPOT: Each voxel = 2-4 screen pixels
      ```

      ### Character Proportions at Different Scales
      ```
      16-voxel tall character:
        Head:  4-5 voxels
        Torso: 5-6 voxels
        Legs:  6-7 voxels
        Arms:  1 voxel wide

      32-voxel tall character:
        Head:  8-10 voxels
        Torso: 10-12 voxels
        Legs:  12-14 voxels
        Arms:  2 voxels wide

      48-voxel tall character:
        Head:  12-15 voxels
        Torso: 15-18 voxels
        Legs:  18-21 voxels
        Arms:  3 voxels wide
      ```

    name: Silhouette-Driven Modeling
    description: |
      Voxels have limited resolution - the silhouette is your primary communication tool.
      Model for silhouette first, detail second.
    when_to_use: All voxel character and prop design
    implementation: |
      ## Silhouette-First Approach

      ### Why Silhouette Matters More in Voxels
      ```
      In traditional 3D:
        - Unlimited polygon resolution for curves
        - Textures add detail at any scale
        - Lighting creates form on smooth surfaces

      In voxels:
        - Fixed grid resolution limits curves
        - "Texture" is just more voxels
        - Stair-stepping breaks smooth lighting

      RESULT: The shape itself carries the message
      ```

      ### The Silhouette Test
      ```
      1. Fill your model with a single solid color
      2. View from all cardinal directions (6 views)
      3. View from all diagonal directions (8 views)
      4. Ask: "Can I identify this without color or detail?"

      If NO: Exaggerate the silhouette before adding detail
      ```

      ### Exaggeration Techniques
      ```
      HEADS: Make them 1.5-2x larger than realistic
        - Draws eye to face
        - More room for expression
        - Classic cartoon proportion

      HANDS: Make them 1.5x larger than realistic
        - Important for tool-using characters
        - Easier to animate visibly

      WEAPONS/TOOLS: Oversized relative to body
        - Must read at gameplay distance
        - Silhouette defines tool type

      SHOULDER WIDTH: Slightly exaggerate
        - Creates heroic proportions
        - Distinguishes from NPCs
      ```

      ### The Rayman Aesthetic
      ```
      A breakthrough in voxel character design:

      Instead of connected limbs:
        - Floating hands (no arms)
        - Floating feet (no legs, or short legs)
        - Focus detail on head, hands, torso

      Benefits:
        - Fewer voxels = better performance
        - No awkward arm/leg articulation
        - Cleaner silhouette in motion
        - Easier animation (fewer parts)

  - id: frame-by-frame-animation
    name: Frame-by-Frame Voxel Animation
    description: |
      Voxel animation uses stop-motion principles, not skeletal rigging. Each frame
      is a complete voxel model, creating a unique aesthetic but significant storage.
    when_to_use: Any animated voxel content
    implementation: |
      ## Frame-by-Frame Animation Pipeline

      ### Why Not Skeletal Animation?
      ```
      Traditional skeletal issues in voxels:
        - Rotation causes voxel "swimming"
        - Scaling creates jagged artifacts
        - Blend weights meaningless on cubes
        - Loses the voxel charm

      Frame-by-frame advantages:
        - Perfect control over every voxel
        - Classic stop-motion aesthetic
        - Snappy, readable motion
        - No runtime deformation cost
      ```

      ### Key Frame Planning
      ```
      WALK CYCLE (8 frames typical):
        Frame 1: Contact (front foot down)
        Frame 2: Recoil (body dips)
        Frame 3: Passing (legs cross)
        Frame 4: High point (back foot lifts)
        Frame 5: Contact (opposite foot)
        Frames 6-8: Mirror of 1-4

      IDLE ANIMATION (4-8 frames):
        - Subtle breathing motion
        - Hold key poses for 2 frames (overlap effect)
        - Small head movements
        - Tool/weapon bob

      ATTACK (3-6 frames):
        Frame 1: Anticipation (wind-up)
        Frame 2-3: Action (strike)
        Frame 4-5: Follow-through
        Frame 6: Recovery
      ```

      ### Overlap and Delay Technique
      ```
      Traditional animation principle adapted:

      When hand reaches extreme position:
        - Hold for 2 frames before reversing
        - Body and legs continue moving
        - Creates "drag" feeling

      Implementation:
        Frame 4: Hand at left extreme, torso centered
        Frame 5: Hand at left extreme (held), torso moves right
        Frame 6: Hand starts right, torso at right extreme
      ```

      ### Storage and Performance Considerations
      ```
      Frame storage calculation:
        Model size: 32x32x32 = 32,768 voxels
        Frames per animation: 8
        Animations per character: 10
        Total voxels: 32,768 x 8 x 10 = 2.6 million voxels

      Optimization strategies:
        1. DELTA FRAMES: Store only changed voxels per frame
        2. SHARED PALETTES: All frames use same 256-color palette
        3. RLE COMPRESSION: Run-length encode empty space
        4. SPRITE SHEETS: For 2D games, render to sprite sheets

      Runtime approach:
        - Precompile animations to mesh sequences
        - Swap meshes per frame (model swapping)
        - Or: Use vertex animation textures (VAT)
      ```

      ### MagicaVoxel Animation Workflow
      ```
      Naming convention:
        character_idle_01.vox
        character_idle_02.vox
        character_walk_01.vox
        ...

      Quick preview in MagicaVoxel:
        1. Name files sequentially (walk1, walk2, walk3)
        2. Click through files quickly in file browser
        3. For accurate preview, export to Maya or use AniVoxel

      Export for game:
        1. Export each frame as OBJ
        2. Import to Blender as sequence
        3. Set up mesh swapping animation
        4. Export as FBX with shape keys or separate meshes
      ```

  - id: mesh-conversion-optimization
    name: Voxel-to-Mesh Conversion
    description: |
      Converting voxels to game-ready meshes requires understanding marching cubes,
      greedy meshing, and the tradeoffs between polygon count and visual fidelity.
    when_to_use: Exporting voxel models for game engines
    implementation: |
      ## Mesh Conversion Methods

      ### Method 1: Naive/Cubic Export
      ```
      Every voxel = 12 triangles (6 faces x 2 tris)

      32x32x32 solid cube = 32,768 voxels = 393,216 triangles
      (Unusable for real-time!)

      When to use:
        - Never for filled volumes
        - Only for single-voxel effects
      ```

      ### Method 2: Face Culling
      ```
      Only render external faces (faces not touching other voxels)

      32x32x32 hollow shell = ~6,000 visible faces = ~12,000 triangles
      (Much better, but still not optimized)

      MagicaVoxel uses this by default for OBJ export
      ```

      ### Method 3: Greedy Meshing (RECOMMENDED)
      ```
      Combine adjacent coplanar faces into larger quads

      How it works:
        1. Find largest rectangle of same-color voxels
        2. Merge into single quad
        3. Repeat for remaining faces

      Result:
        32x32x32 with greedy = 100-500 triangles (varies by complexity)
        95%+ reduction from face culling!

      Tools that support greedy meshing:
        - Optivox (dedicated voxel optimizer)
        - Avoyd Voxel Editor
        - Custom scripts (0fps.net has reference implementation)

      Limitation:
        - All merged voxels must be SAME material/color
        - Different colors = different quads
      ```

      ### Method 4: Marching Cubes (Smooth Voxels)
      ```
      Creates smooth surfaces from voxel data

      Pros:
        - Rounded, organic shapes
        - Good for terrain
        - Natural-looking results

      Cons:
        - Loses blocky voxel aesthetic
        - Can create artifacts at sharp edges
        - Higher polygon count
        - Coplanar face issues (see sharp-edges)

      MagicaVoxel: Export > Marching Cubes option

      Best for:
        - Terrain that should look natural
        - Organic shapes (clouds, rocks)
        - When you DON'T want the voxel look
      ```

      ### Optimization Pipeline (Recommended)
      ```
      1. Export from MagicaVoxel as OBJ (face culled)
      2. Import to Blender
      3. Apply Limited Dissolve (merge coplanar)
      4. Apply Decimate modifier (for LODs)
      5. Export as FBX/glTF

      Blender optimization script:
        bpy.ops.mesh.dissolve_limited(angle_limit=0.0001)
        bpy.ops.mesh.tris_to_quads()

      Expected results:
        Original:      10,000 triangles
        After dissolve: 500-2,000 triangles
        LOD1 (50%):    250-1,000 triangles
        LOD2 (25%):    125-500 triangles
      ```

    name: Destructible Voxel Systems
    description: |
      Designing voxel content for destruction requires understanding structural
      integrity, chunk management, and physics performance.
    when_to_use: Teardown-style destruction, mining games, building games
    implementation: |
      ## Destructible Voxel Architecture

      ### Teardown's Approach (Lessons Learned)
      ```
      Key insight from Dennis Gustafsson:
        "Destructible voxels are easier than polygons because
         they're so much easier to work with for physics."

      Implementation:
        - Multiple small voxel volumes, not one giant volume
        - Each volume can translate independently
        - 8-bit color palette per material
        - Ray marching for rendering (not polygon conversion)

      Why multiple volumes:
        - Local translation when piece breaks off
        - Chunk-based physics simulation
        - Memory management (load/unload chunks)
      ```

      ### Structural Integrity Basics
      ```
      The problem:
        - Remove support voxels, structure should collapse
        - But computing full structural analysis is expensive

      Teardown's compromise:
        - Small structures: Accurate structural integrity
        - Large structures: Simplified approximation
        - Reason: Computational cost doesn't scale

      For your game:
        Option 1: Simple connectivity (cheap)
          - Flood fill from ground
          - Disconnected = falls

        Option 2: Stress simulation (expensive)
          - Weight flows through structure
          - Overloaded supports break
          - More realistic but costly

        Option 3: Teardown hybrid
          - Simple for large
          - Detailed for small pieces
          - Threshold determines cutoff
      ```

      ### Chunk-Based World Management
      ```
      Don't store as single volume:
        - 512x512x256 world = 67 million voxels
        - Too large for memory
        - Can't update efficiently

      Chunk approach:
        - Divide into 32x32x32 chunks
        - Only load visible chunks
        - Regenerate mesh when chunk modified

      Chunk modification workflow:
        1. Player destroys voxel
        2. Identify affected chunk
        3. Update chunk voxel data
        4. Flag chunk for re-mesh
        5. Regenerate mesh (background thread)
        6. Swap old mesh for new

      Target: <1ms for re-mesh (from Fugl developer)
      ```

      ### Material Properties for Destruction
      ```
      8-bit palette approach (per voxel):
        Bits 0-5: Color index (64 colors)
        Bits 6-7: Material type (4 types)

      Material types affect:
        - Destruction resistance (hits to break)
        - Debris behavior (crumble vs shatter)
        - Sound on impact
        - Physics properties (density, friction)

      Example materials:
        Type 0: Stone  (high resistance, crumble)
        Type 1: Wood   (medium resistance, splinter)
        Type 2: Metal  (high resistance, dent then break)
        Type 3: Glass  (low resistance, shatter)
      ```

      STEP 1: Export from MagicaVoxel
        Format: OBJ (includes MTL and PNG palette)
        Settings: Default (face culled)

      STEP 2: Optimize in Blender (optional but recommended)
        - Import OBJ
        - Apply Limited Dissolve
        - Create LODs with Decimate modifier
        - Export as FBX

      STEP 3: Unity Import Settings
        Model:
          - Scale Factor: 1 (if modeled at correct scale)
          - Import Normals: Import
          - Generate Lightmap UVs: YES (important!)

        Materials:
          - Create new Material
          - Base Map: Use exported palette PNG
          - Ensure: Unlit or appropriate shader

      STEP 4: Collision
        - Generate Colliders: Mesh Collider (static)
        - For dynamic: Create simplified box/capsule
      ```

      ### MagicaVoxel to Unreal Engine
      ```
      STEP 1: Export as OBJ or FBX
        OBJ for static meshes
        FBX if need hierarchy

      STEP 2: Import to Unreal
        Import Settings:
          - Convert Scene: ON
          - Import Normals: Import Normals and Tangents
          - Auto Generate Collision: ON (simple)

      STEP 3: Material Setup
        1. Create Material Instance
        2. Base Color: Sample palette texture
        3. For crisp voxels: Disable mip maps on texture
        4. Nearest neighbor filtering (no blur)

      STEP 4: LOD Setup
        - Import LOD meshes with _LOD0, _LOD1, etc. suffix
        - Or generate in Unreal (less control)
        - Set LOD distances based on screen percentage
      ```

      ### MagicaVoxel to Godot
      ```
      STEP 1: Export as glTF (preferred) or OBJ
        glTF preserves more material data

      STEP 2: Blender Intermediate (recommended)
        - Import to Blender
        - Optimize mesh
        - Export as glTF (.glb)

      STEP 3: Godot Import
        Import dock settings:
          - Generate Collision: Convex (dynamic) or Trimesh (static)
          - Generate Lightmap UV: ON

      STEP 4: Material
        - Godot auto-creates material from glTF
        - Modify: Set texture filter to Nearest (no blur)
        - For pixel-perfect: Disable mipmaps
      ```

      ### Texture Settings for Crisp Voxels
      ```
      The cardinal sin: Blurry voxels from texture filtering

      FIX in all engines:
        - Filter Mode: Point (Nearest Neighbor)
        - Generate Mipmaps: OFF
        - Compression: None or Lossless

      Without this, voxel edges blur together at angles
      ```

anti_patterns:
  - id: overdetailing-small-scale
    name: Over-Detailing at Small Scale
    description: |
      Adding detail that won't be visible at the camera distance the asset will
      be viewed from. This wastes voxels, increases polygon count, and often
      makes the model LESS readable.
    why_bad: |
      - Detail becomes visual noise at distance
      - Increases polygon count for no benefit
      - Reduces silhouette clarity
      - Wastes artist time
      - Can make characters look "dirty" or cluttered
    what_to_do_instead: |
      1. Always test at actual gameplay camera distance
      2. Use color variation instead of geometry for detail
      3. Follow the 2-4 pixel per voxel rule
      4. Exaggerate important features, simplify unimportant ones
      5. "Would I see this at 50% zoom?" If no, remove it.

  - id: ignoring-palette-design
    name: Using Random Colors
    description: |
      Picking colors without a cohesive palette plan, leading to muddy,
      unreadable, or jarring visual results.
    why_bad: |
      - Lacks visual cohesion
      - Makes silhouettes harder to read
      - Limits reuse across models
      - Professional voxel art always uses curated palettes
      - Makes material identification difficult
    what_to_do_instead: |
      1. Design palette BEFORE modeling
      2. Limit to 16-64 colors for consistency
      3. Group colors by material type
      4. Include shadow/highlight variants per color
      5. Reference classic palettes (NES, CGA, custom curated)

  - id: mesh-export-without-optimization
    name: Exporting Without Mesh Optimization
    description: |
      Exporting voxel models directly to game engines without applying greedy
      meshing or face optimization, resulting in massive polygon counts.
    why_bad: |
      - 10x-100x more polygons than necessary
      - Kills game performance
      - Larger file sizes
      - Slower load times
      - Can't have many voxel objects on screen
    what_to_do_instead: |
      1. Use Optivox or Avoyd for automatic greedy meshing
      2. Or import to Blender and apply Limited Dissolve
      3. Create proper LOD chain
      4. Test polygon count before shipping
      5. Target: <1000 tris for small props, <5000 for characters

  - id: animation-storage-explosion
    name: Ignoring Animation Storage Costs
    description: |
      Creating many animation frames without considering the exponential storage
      and memory costs of frame-by-frame voxel animation.
    why_bad: |
      - Each frame is a full copy of the model
      - 8-frame walk cycle = 8x storage of static model
      - 10 animations = 80x storage
      - Mobile games can't handle this
      - Increases load times dramatically
    what_to_do_instead: |
      1. Plan animation count before production
      2. Use delta compression (store only changes)
      3. Consider sprite sheet rendering for mobile
      4. Limit frame count (4-6 frames often enough)
      5. Share animations across similar characters

  - id: marching-cubes-for-blocky
    name: Using Marching Cubes for Blocky Aesthetic
    description: |
      Using marching cubes export when you want to preserve the blocky voxel look,
      destroying the intentional aesthetic.
    why_bad: |
      - Removes the voxel charm
      - Looks like generic low-poly 3D
      - Higher polygon count than necessary
      - Introduces mesh artifacts
      - Defeats the purpose of voxel art
    what_to_do_instead: |
      1. Use standard OBJ export for blocky look
      2. Apply greedy meshing to optimize
      3. Only use marching cubes for terrain or organic shapes
      4. If smooth is needed, consider starting with traditional 3D instead

  - id: ignoring-camera-distance
    name: Designing Without Camera Context
    description: |
      Creating voxel models without considering the actual camera distance and
      resolution they'll be viewed at in the final game.
    why_bad: |
      - Detail invisible at gameplay distance
      - Models may be too small or too large
      - Voxels become sub-pixel (wastes resolution)
      - Visual identity gets lost
    what_to_do_instead: |
      1. Set up test scene with actual game camera
      2. Model at visible resolution only
      3. Test frequently at final view distance
      4. Adjust model resolution based on screen size
