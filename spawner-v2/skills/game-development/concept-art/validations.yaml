# Summary validation that ties to skill patterns
meta:
  validation_philosophy: |
    These validations enforce the discipline that separates professional
    concept artists from hobbyists. They may feel bureaucratic, but each
    checkbox represents a lesson learned from production failures.

    Key principles:
    1. Exploration before refinement (thumbnails)
    2. Value before color (composition)
    3. Design before rendering (approval gates)
    4. Buildability before beauty (production awareness)
    5. Options before attachment (multiple solutions)
