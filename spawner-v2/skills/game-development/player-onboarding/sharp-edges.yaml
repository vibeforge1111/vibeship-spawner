# Player Onboarding Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that kill retention, frustrate players, and tank your game's success

  - id: tutorial-jail-syndrome
    summary: Players quit because they're trapped in tutorial before experiencing the "real" game
    severity: critical
    situation: Tutorial is 10+ minutes before player experiences core gameplay loop
    why: |
      Studies show 60%+ of players quit during tutorials that exceed 3 minutes on mobile,
      10 minutes on PC/console. Players downloaded your game to PLAY, not to be lectured.
      The longer before "real" gameplay, the higher your drop-off rate.

      Actual data from mobile games:
      - 3 minute tutorial: 40% drop-off
      - 5 minute tutorial: 55% drop-off
      - 10 minute tutorial: 75% drop-off

      You're literally teaching players to quit.
    solution: |
      # The core loop should start within 30 seconds

      # WRONG approach:
      gameStart() {
        this.playIntroVideo()        # 2 min
        this.showStoryExposition()   # 3 min
        this.teachMovement()         # 2 min
        this.teachCombat()           # 3 min
        this.teachInventory()        # 2 min
        this.startRealGame()         # Player left 10 minutes ago
      }

      # RIGHT approach:
      gameStart() {
        # Player playing in 10 seconds
        this.dropPlayerIntoAction()

        # Teach ONE thing (movement)
        # Then let them play for 60 seconds

        # Teach next thing when they need it
        # Sprinkle teaching across first 30 minutes
      }

      # Measure: What percentage of players reach core loop?
      # Target: 80%+ should reach real gameplay
    symptoms:
      - Multi-step forced tutorial before gameplay
      - Players asking "when does the game start"
      - High drop-off before level 1 completion
      - Tutorial completion rate below 60%

  - id: information-overload-dump
    summary: Overwhelming players with all mechanics at once causes them to remember nothing
    severity: critical
    situation: Showing 5+ controls, mechanics, or systems in first few minutes
    why: |
      Cognitive psychology: Working memory holds 4 items (not 7 as old studies claimed).
      Dumping 10 controls means players retain maybe 2, randomly.

      The "curse of knowledge" - you know your game deeply, so everything feels simple.
      To new players, it's all foreign.

      Additionally, anxiety increases with complexity. Overwhelmed players feel
      incompetent and quit to protect ego.
    solution: |

        }
      }

      # Breath of the Wild teaches for 10+ HOURS
      # Players don't even realize they're still learning
    symptoms:
      - Control screen with 8+ bindings
      - Multiple popups in quick succession
      - Players asking "what button does X"
      - Players using only 2-3 mechanics despite knowing more

  - id: explain-obvious-mechanics
    summary: Telling players to "move with WASD" insults intelligence and creates prompt fatigue
    severity: high
    situation: Explaining movement, camera, or other genre-standard controls
    why: |
      Every gamer knows WASD/Arrow keys = movement, mouse = camera, Space = jump.
      Explaining this:
      1. Wastes precious first-impression time
      2. Insults the player ("do they think I'm stupid?")
      3. Trains players to IGNORE all prompts

      Once players learn your prompts are obvious, they'll skip important ones too.
    solution: |
      # Only teach what's NOT obvious

      # Standard controls that DON'T need teaching:
      skipTeaching = [
        'WASD/Arrow movement',
        'Mouse camera control',
        'Space to jump',
        'Click to select',
        'Escape for menu',
        'Scroll to zoom'

        'Non-standard bindings',
        'Hidden features',
        'Combo systems',
        'Context-sensitive actions'
      ]

      # Test: Can you find someone who doesn't know this?
      # If everyone knows it, don't teach it.
    symptoms:
      - Tutorial for standard FPS/platformer controls
      - "Move with WASD" popup
      - Teaching mouse look in first-person game
      - Players visibly annoyed at basic prompts

  - id: forced-watching-before-playing
    summary: Making players watch before they can interact loses them immediately
    severity: high
    situation: Cutscenes, videos, or text before first input
    why: |
      The single most predictive metric for retention is "time to first input."
      Every second of watching = percentage of players lost.

      Mobile games measure in SECONDS:
      - 5s to first input: Baseline
      - 10s to first input: 10% drop-off
      - 30s to first input: 25% drop-off

      Players came to PLAY. Passive content is the opposite of play.
    solution: |
      # First input within 5 seconds

      class GameStart {
        constructor() {
          # NO unskippable logos

        }

        # Start with action, explain later
        # "In medias res" - drop into the middle of things
      }
    symptoms:

  - id: hard-fail-during-tutorial
    summary: Punishing players for experimentation during learning phase
    severity: high
    situation: Game over, lost progress, or harsh penalties during first attempts
    why: |
      Learning requires failure. If failure is punished, players stop experimenting.
      Fear of failure → conservative play → never learn advanced techniques.

      Worse: embarrassing deaths during tutorial = rage quit.
      "I can't even beat the TUTORIAL?"

      The tutorial should be impossible to fail, or failure should be instant-retry.

  - id: skipping-breaks-game
    summary: Skip tutorial but game assumes you completed it, causing confusion or softlock
    severity: high
    situation: Skip option exists but doesn't properly initialize game state
    why: |
      If you offer skip, 30-50% of players will use it.
      If their game is then broken, they'll leave a 1-star review.

      Common failures:
      - Items that should have been collected
      - Abilities that should be unlocked
      - NPCs in wrong state
      - Triggers never fired

  - id: no-skip-on-replay
    summary: Forcing the tutorial every new game punishes replayability
    severity: high
    situation: Tutorial is mandatory on every playthrough
    why: |
      Players who love your game want to replay it.
      Forcing them through baby-steps tutorial is punishment for being fans.

      Speedrunners, achievement hunters, content creators all suffer.
      Some will simply stop replaying.

  - id: wrong-thing-first
    summary: Teaching secondary mechanics before core loop causes confusion about game identity
    severity: medium
    situation: Tutorial for crafting before combat, or inventory before movement
    why: |
      Players form mental model of your game in first 2 minutes.
      If first thing they learn is inventory management, they think it's inventory game.
      Then when combat starts, they're confused about "what this game is."

      Core fantasy must be delivered first.
    solution: |

  - id: single-path-assumption
    summary: Tutorial assumes one correct solution, breaking for creative players
    severity: medium
    situation: Player solves tutorial "wrong" and gets stuck or confused
    why: |
      Players are creative. They'll try unexpected solutions.
      If your tutorial only works one way, creative players get stuck.

      Example: Tutorial says "jump on box to reach ledge."
      Player uses rocket jump instead. Box is still there, blocking progress.

    symptoms:

    severity: medium
    situation: "Did you forget to press X?" appearing every 10 seconds
    why: |
      Not every pause is confusion. Sometimes players want to explore.
      Constant hints communicate "you're doing it wrong."

      Hint fatigue: After being interrupted 5 times, players ignore ALL hints.
      When they actually need help later, they've learned to dismiss.

        # Mobile-specific patterns:
        # - One-finger controls only initially
        # - Portrait mode first (most intimate)

        # - Save constantly (could close any moment)
        # - Show progress visually (no text reading)
