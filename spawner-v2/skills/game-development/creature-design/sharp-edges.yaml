  - id: creature-immovable-design
    summary: Designing creatures that can't move believably
    severity: critical
    situation: You create a creature design that looks great as static art but falls apart when animated
    why: |
      Animation is the majority of a creature's life in a game. A creature that
      can't be rigged and animated convincingly will either look broken in motion
      or require costly redesign. Common issues: joints that can't bend in needed
      directions, limbs that would collide with body, tails/wings with no attachment
      logic, proportions that make walk cycles impossible.
    solution: |
      1. Design movement BEFORE finalizing visuals
      2. Sketch at minimum: idle, walk, attack, hit reaction, death
      3. Consult with animators during concept phase
      4. Create joint placement diagrams alongside design
      5. Test: "Can I imagine this skeleton? Can it bend this way?"
      6. Study real animal locomotion for reference
    symptoms:
      - Animator says "this can't walk"
      - Legs clip through body during movement
      - Attack animations look awkward
      - Rigging takes 5x expected time
      - Creature looks stiff or robotic in motion

  - id: creature-silhouette-blob
    summary: Creature silhouette reads as formless blob
    severity: high
    situation: Your creature has lots of detail but fills with black, it's just an oval or generic shape
    why: |
      Players identify creatures at a glance. In gameplay, creatures are often
      seen at distance, in motion, against various backgrounds. If the silhouette
      doesn't communicate identity and threat, players get confused, miss threats,
      or can't distinguish creature types. This is especially critical in action
      games where split-second recognition matters.
    solution: |
      1. BLACK FILL TEST: Fill design with solid black, view at 32x32 pixels
      2. Add LANDMARKS: distinctive protrusions (horns, wings, tail spikes)
      3. Create NEGATIVE SPACE: gaps between limbs and body
      4. ASYMMETRY: break perfect symmetry for interest
      5. Test against LINEUP: place with other creatures, all distinct?
      6. Test at GAMEPLAY DISTANCE: does it read at actual camera view?
    symptoms:
      - Can't tell creatures apart in gameplay
      - Players don't react appropriately to threat
      - "What was that thing?" complaints
      - Art looks great in portfolio, fails in game
      - Creatures blend into backgrounds

  - id: creature-overdesign-syndrome
    summary: Adding complexity until creature becomes visual noise
    severity: high
    situation: You keep adding spikes, eyes, textures, and details to make creature more impressive
    why: |
      More detail does not equal better design. Excessive complexity creates:
      visual noise that's hard to read, animation nightmares, performance issues
      from high-poly models, difficulty scaling to different resolutions, and
      muddy silhouettes. Blizzard's creature designs are often simpler than they
      seem - impact comes from refinement, not addition.
    solution: |
      1. Apply "Would anyone miss this?" test to every element
      2. Use the RULE OF THREE: three main elements maximum
      3. Detail should support, not compete with, main forms
      4. Test at SMALLEST resolution the creature will appear
      5. Simplicity is strength - Pokemon proves this constantly
      6. If explaining the design takes more than one sentence, simplify
    symptoms:
      - Creature looks like "visual noise"
      - Hard to focus on any particular element
      - Looks worse at distance than up close
      - Animation team overwhelmed by moving elements
      - Players describe it as "busy" or "cluttered"

  - id: creature-scale-ignorance
    summary: Designing without considering size implications
    severity: high
    situation: You design a massive creature with thin spindly legs, or tiny creature with heavy proportions
    why: |
      Physics applies to fantasy. The square-cube law means large creatures need
      proportionally thicker legs, smaller heads relative to body, and slower
      movement. Small creatures can have thin limbs and large heads. When this
      is violated, designs feel "wrong" even if viewers can't articulate why.
      Paleontologists and biologists have well-established rules.
    solution: |
      1. SMALL creatures: thin limbs OK, large head OK, fast movement OK
      2. MEDIUM creatures: proportional limbs, balanced head, normal movement
      3. LARGE creatures: thick columnar legs, small head ratio, slow movement
      4. MASSIVE creatures: pillar legs, tiny head ratio, geological movement
      5. Study real megafauna (elephants, whales, dinosaurs)
      6. If defying physics, need in-world explanation (magic, different gravity)
    symptoms:
      - Creature feels "unstable" or "wrong"
      - Animation of movement looks impossible
      - Giant creatures look fragile
      - Small creatures look ponderous
      - Viewers say "that doesn't look right"

  - id: creature-photoshop-hybrid
    summary: Hybrid creature looks like animal parts pasted together
    severity: high
    situation: You combine multiple animals but result feels like a bad Photoshop composite
    why: |
      Real hybrids in nature (or convincing fantasy) have unified design logic.
      Parts need to connect anatomically, share consistent integument (skin/fur/scales),
      and have evolutionary justification. When parts are just "attached," viewers
      instantly sense the artificiality. This breaks immersion and makes the
      creature forgettable or comedic when that's not intended.
    solution: |
      1. Use 60-30-10 RULE: 60% primary animal, 30% secondary, 10% unique
      2. Design the SKELETON first - how do parts connect?
      3. Unify INTEGUMENT: one skin logic throughout
      4. Create TRANSITION ZONES where elements meet
      5. Ask "WHY did this evolve?" - have an answer
      6. Study real hybrids: ligers, mules, biological oddities
    symptoms:
      - Creature looks "assembled"
      - Visible "seams" between different animal parts
      - Viewers describe it as "Photoshopped"
      - No sense of how it would have evolved
      - Parts don't scale correctly relative to each other

  - id: creature-ecosystem-orphan
    summary: Creature that doesn't fit its world's ecosystem
    severity: medium
    situation: You design a cool creature in isolation without considering what it eats, what eats it, and where it lives
    why: |
      Creatures exist in context. A predator needs prey. A prey creature needs
      food sources. An arctic creature in a desert breaks immersion. Even fantasy
      worlds have internal logic. When creatures don't fit their ecosystem, the
      world feels like a collection of assets rather than a living place. Players
      notice these inconsistencies even subconsciously.
    solution: |
      1. Design ECOSYSTEMS, not isolated creatures
      2. Answer: What does it eat? What eats it? Where does it live?
      3. Create food chain: producers → herbivores → predators → apex
      4. Match creature adaptations to environment (desert = heat adaptation)
      5. Consider creature interactions (predator-prey relationships)
      6. Use regional variants for different biomes
    symptoms:
      - "What does this thing even do?" questions
      - World feels like a creature zoo, not living ecosystem
      - Creatures seem randomly placed
      - No sense of food chain or natural order
      - Players don't understand creature behaviors

  - id: creature-horror-cute-miscalibration
    summary: Attempting cute and landing in uncanny valley, or attempting horror and getting silly
    severity: medium
    situation: Your "cute" creature creeps people out, or your "terrifying" creature makes them laugh
    why: |
      Cute and horror are precise targets that require specific techniques. Cute
      requires baby schema (large eyes low on face, round body, small limbs). Horror
      requires "wrongness" (anatomical violations, movement errors). Getting between
      these creates uncanny valley for cute or comedic for horror. Eyes are usually
      the problem - too realistic on a cute design, or too cartoonish on horror.
    solution: |
      FOR CUTE:
      - Eyes: Simple dots or stylized (NOT realistic)
      - Proportions: Baby-like (big head, small body)
      - Shapes: Round, soft, no sharp edges
      - Expressions: Clear, readable, exaggerated

      FOR HORROR:
      - Eyes: Wrong (too many, too human, or absent)
      - Proportions: Violated (wrong size relationships)
      - Shapes: Angular, sharp, asymmetric
      - Movement: Unnatural, wrong speed, wrong articulation
    symptoms:
      - Cute design described as "creepy" or "unsettling"
      - Horror design gets laughs instead of screams
      - Players avoid "cute" companion creature
      - "Scary" enemy becomes community joke
      - Merchandise of cute creature doesn't sell

  - id: creature-sound-design-afterthought
    summary: Designing creature visuals without considering audio
    severity: medium
    situation: You finalize creature design before talking to audio team, then struggle to match sounds
    why: |
      Sound is half of creature design. A massive creature that makes squeaky sounds
      breaks immersion. A tiny creature with booming footsteps is comedic (unless
      intentional). Visual and audio design must work together. Creatures should
      visually suggest their sounds - body cavity size implies vocalization depth,
      surface materials imply movement sounds, attack types imply impact sounds.
    solution: |
      1. Design should IMPLY sound:
         - Large hollow body = deep resonant voice
         - Small compact body = higher pitch
         - Hard shell = clicking, clacking
         - Soft flesh = wet, squelching
      2. Work with audio team during concept phase
      3. Create sound reference notes with design
      4. Consider: footsteps, vocalizations, attacks, death
      5. Test designs by imagining audio first
    symptoms:
      - Audio team says "what sound does this make?"
      - Creature sounds don't match appearance
      - Constant back-and-forth with audio team
      - Sound design feels "off" even when technically correct
      - Players describe creature audio as "wrong"

  - id: creature-threat-level-unreadable
    summary: Players can't tell how dangerous creature is by looking at it
    severity: high
    situation: Harmless ambient creatures look as threatening as bosses, or dangerous enemies look cute
    why: |
      Games require threat communication. Players need to instantly assess: "Do I
      fight this, flee from it, or ignore it?" Visual design must communicate
      this. If all creatures use the same visual language (all scary, all cute,
      no hierarchy), players can't make informed decisions. This breaks gameplay
      and creates frustration.
    solution: |
      CREATE THREAT SPECTRUM:

      HARMLESS (ambient life):
      - Round shapes, soft colors
      - Smaller than player
      - Wide-set eyes, no visible weapons

      LOW THREAT (early enemies):
      - Some angular elements
      - Similar size to player
      - Small visible weapons

      DANGEROUS (mid-game):
      - Angular shapes, spikes
      - Larger than player
      - Prominent attack features

      DEADLY (bosses):
      - Complex, threatening silhouette
      - Much larger than player
      - Multiple obvious threat elements
    symptoms:
      - Players attack friendly creatures
      - Players ignore dangerous enemies
      - "How was I supposed to know that was dangerous?"
      - Constantly surprising players unfairly
      - Combat encounters feel random, not designed

  - id: creature-animation-budget-killer
    summary: Design requires animation budget that doesn't exist
    severity: high
    situation: You design creature with flowing tentacles, multiple wings, and secondary motion elements without considering animation cost
    why: |
      Every moving element requires animation resources. Flowing capes, multiple
      tentacles, secondary motion on ears/tails/fins - each adds workload.
      AAA studios have animation teams of dozens. Indie studios might have one
      animator. Design must match production realities. A simpler creature well-
      animated beats a complex creature poorly animated every time.
    solution: |
      1. Know your ANIMATION BUDGET before designing
      2. Count MOVING ELEMENTS: each one costs animator time
      3. Consider PHYSICS SIMULATION: cloth, tentacles, chains
      4. Design SIMPLER versions for different production scales
      5. Prioritize: What motion is ESSENTIAL vs nice-to-have?
      6. Work with animators on feasibility during concept
    symptoms:
      - Animation takes months instead of weeks
      - Team cuts features from creature
      - Final creature looks stiff compared to concept
      - Budget/schedule overruns
      - "We can't animate that" feedback

  - id: creature-rigging-nightmare
    summary: Design creates impossible rigging requirements
    severity: critical
    situation: You design a creature that looks cool but riggers can't figure out how to set up the skeleton
    why: |
      Rigging is the technical foundation of animation. Certain designs create
      problems: limbs that clip through body, no clear joint locations, deformation
      areas with no defined behavior, multiple overlapping elements. If riggers
      can't create a clean skeleton, the creature will never animate well. This
      is expensive to fix after design is approved.
    solution: |
      1. Consider JOINT PLACEMENT during design
      2. Ensure CLEAR DEFORMATION AREAS (elbows, knees, spine)
      3. Avoid limb placements that cause CLIPPING
      4. Design WING ATTACHMENT with movement range in mind
      5. Plan for FACIAL RIGGING if expressions needed
      6. Consult riggers during concept phase
      7. Create skeletal overlay diagrams with designs
    symptoms:
      - Rigger asks "where are the joints?"
      - Multiple rigging attempts
      - Clipping during standard animations
      - Face can't hold expressions
      - Wings clip through body
      - Tail collides with legs

  - id: creature-boss-attack-unreadable
    summary: Boss creature design doesn't telegraph attacks clearly
    severity: high
    situation: You design an impressive boss but players can't tell when or how it's attacking
    why: |
      Boss fights require the player to learn patterns. If attacks can't be
      predicted by reading visual tells, the fight becomes frustrating guesswork.
      Great bosses (Dark Souls, Monster Hunter) have clear wind-up animations
      that teach players through visual language. The creature design must support
      these telegraphs - attack limbs should be visually prominent.
    solution: |
      1. ATTACK ZONES: Design clear "weapon" elements (claws, tail, horns)
      2. HIGHLIGHT: Attack tools should be visually emphasized
      3. WIND-UP SPACE: Design poses that can telegraph incoming attacks
      4. WEAK POINTS: Visible, distinct from armored areas
      5. PHASE CHANGES: Design "damaged" or "enraged" variants
      6. Test: Could animator create clear anticipation poses?
    symptoms:
      - Players say "where did that come from?"
      - Can't tell which attack is coming
      - No sense of when safe to attack
      - Weak points aren't obvious
      - Phase transitions are confusing

  - id: creature-family-sameness
    summary: Multiple creature types in same family are indistinguishable
    severity: medium
    situation: You design a creature family (goblin variants, wolf types, etc.) and players can't tell them apart
    why: |
      Games often need creature families - the same base creature with variants
      for different threat levels, locations, or abilities. If these variants
      are too similar, players lose tactical information ("Is that the dangerous
      one or the weak one?") and the game feels visually monotonous. Each variant
      needs distinct silhouette while maintaining family resemblance.
    solution: |
      1. LINEUP TEST: Place all variants side by side as silhouettes
      2. Each variant needs UNIQUE SILHOUETTE ELEMENT
      3. Use SIZE to communicate hierarchy
      4. Use COLOR to differentiate (but don't rely only on color)
      5. Maintain FAMILY DNA (shared elements) but vary key features
      6. Test: Can player name each variant from silhouette?
    symptoms:
      - "Which one is that?"
      - Players don't adjust tactics for variants
      - Combat feels repetitive
      - Can't tell weak from strong versions
      - Screenshots show "same creature many times"

  - id: creature-gameplay-mismatch
    summary: Creature's visual design doesn't match its gameplay role
    severity: high
    situation: A creature designed to look slow and heavy is actually fast in gameplay, or vice versa
    why: |
      Visual design creates expectations. A bulky, armored creature should BE
      slow and tanky. A sleek, agile creature should BE fast. When visuals and
      gameplay don't match, players feel cheated or confused. They make incorrect
      tactical decisions based on visual information, then get punished for reading
      the visual language "correctly."
    solution: |
      1. Match VISUAL WEIGHT to gameplay weight
      2. Fast creatures: Streamlined, light builds
      3. Slow creatures: Heavy, bulky, armored builds
      4. Ranged threats: Visible ranged attack mechanism
      5. Melee threats: Visible melee weapons
      6. Flying enemies: Wings appropriate to flight style
      7. If subverting expectations, do so deliberately with clear reason
    symptoms:
      - "That looked slow, why is it so fast?"
      - Players make wrong tactical decisions
      - Feedback that creature "cheats"
      - Gap between visuals and feel
      - Designer defense: "It's supposed to be a surprise"

  - id: creature-cultural-insensitivity
    summary: Creature design unintentionally uses offensive or stereotypical cultural elements
    severity: critical
    situation: You incorporate cultural elements (tribal patterns, religious symbols, regional features) without research
    why: |
      Game creatures often draw from world cultures for inspiration. Without proper
      research and consultation, designs can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, use
      sacred symbols inappropriately, or create offensive caricatures. This damages
      players from those cultures, creates PR crises, and often requires costly
      redesigns post-launch.
    solution: |
      1. RESEARCH thoroughly any cultural elements
      2. CONSULT people from the culture you're referencing
      3. Understand HISTORICAL CONTEXT of elements you use
      4. Avoid combining sacred symbols with monster designs
      5. When in doubt, GET EXPERT REVIEW
      6. Consider: Would someone from this culture feel respected?
      7. "Inspired by" is not "copy stereotypes of"
    symptoms:
      - Social media backlash
      - Calls for redesign
      - Players from culture refusing to engage
      - PR team involvement
      - Post-launch removal/redesign

  - id: creature-secondary-motion-chaos
    summary: Too many secondary motion elements creating visual chaos
    severity: medium
    situation: Creature has flowing hair, tentacles, multiple tails, cape, and dozens of moving elements
    why: |
      Secondary motion (parts that react to primary animation) adds life but can
      overwhelm. When everything moves, nothing reads. The eye can't focus on
      important elements like attack tells. Physics simulation of many elements
      is expensive and can cause performance issues. Simplicity often reads
      better than complexity.
    solution: |
      1. LIMIT secondary elements to 2-3 major ones
      2. HIERARCHY: Primary action (attack) must read through secondary
      3. Consider PERFORMANCE cost of each simulated element
      4. Can elements be BAKED or SPRITE-BASED instead of simulated?
      5. Test: Does attack animation read clearly with all motion?
      6. Sometimes stillness creates better contrast
    symptoms:
      - Creature is "visual soup" in motion
      - Can't tell what it's doing
      - Performance drops during creature animations
      - Animation team overwhelmed
      - More secondary elements keep getting added
