# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Biology/Paleontology
    insight: |
      Biologists and paleontologists know anatomy:
      - Evolution solves problems in limited ways
      - Form follows function across all life
      - Real animal weirdness often exceeds fantasy
      - Square-cube law governs all large creatures
      Creature design is applied evolutionary biology.
    applies_when: "Designing any creature that needs to feel real or evolved"

  - domain: Horror Film/Games
    insight: |
      Horror designers know fear:
      - Wrongness triggers instinctive unease
      - Less is more - imagination is scarier
      - Sound is half of horror
      - Familiar-made-wrong is most disturbing
      Study Silent Hill, Alien, The Thing for creature horror.
    applies_when: "Designing horror or threatening creatures"

  - domain: Children's Media
    insight: |
      Children's designers know appeal:
      - Baby schema (neoteny) triggers care instinct
      - Simple shapes are more readable and lovable
      - Expressiveness enables emotional connection
      - Merchandise potential = design quality
      Study Pokemon, Ghibli, Pixar for creature appeal.
    applies_when: "Designing cute, friendly, or companion creatures"

  - domain: Animation
    insight: |
      Animators know movement:
      - Movement reveals character
      - Anticipation-action-reaction structures all motion
      - Weight and momentum must read in design
      - If you can't animate it, it won't work
      Collaborate with animators early and often.
    applies_when: "Designing any creature that will be animated"

  - domain: Game Design
    insight: |
      Game designers know function:
      - Creatures serve gameplay purposes
      - Threat communication enables fair combat
      - Visual language guides player decisions
      - Ecosystem design creates world believability
      Every creature is a game mechanic in biological form.
