    title: Magic Systems Break Economics If Not Constrained
    description: Free energy, teleportation, and creation magic destroy normal economies
    symptoms:
      - Players find exploits that make money trivial
      - "Why would anyone farm if you can create food?"
      - Trade routes make no sense with teleportation
      - Entire professions become pointless

      Magic Must Have Economic Constraints:

      Common problems and fixes:

      **Creation Magic:**
      ```yaml
      problem: "Create Food" spell makes farming obsolete

      fix_options:
        - cost_limit: "Requires rare ingredients worth more than food"
        - quality_limit: "Created food lacks nutrition, causes illness long-term"
        - access_limit: "Only 1 in 10,000 can use magic"
        - complexity_limit: "Can only create what you perfectly understand (no bread, too complex)"

      example:
        name: "Conjure Meal"
        cost: "1 gold worth of ritual components"
        limit: "Creates 1 meal that satisfies for 4 hours, not 24"
        implication: "Still useful for emergencies, but farming remains essential"
      ```

      **Teleportation:**
      ```yaml
      problem: Teleportation makes trade routes obsolete

      fix_options:
        - mass_limit: "Can only teleport yourself, not goods"
        - distance_limit: "Short range only (line of sight)"
        - anchor_limit: "Must travel to a place first before you can teleport there"
        - cost_limit: "Energy cost scales with mass exponentially"
        - risk_limit: "Chance of failure/mishap increases with distance"

      example:
        name: "Waypoint Travel"
        limit: "Only between prepared Waypoints (expensive to create)"
        cost: "1% of goods value per use"
        implication: "Used for high-value, time-sensitive goods. Bulk trade still by ship."
      ```

      **Healing Magic:**
      ```yaml
      problem: Perfect healing removes stakes from combat

      fix_options:
        - time_limit: "Healing takes hours, not seconds"
        - scar_limit: "Wounds heal but leave lasting effects"
        - death_limit: "Can't reverse death, only stabilize dying"
        - cost_limit: "Healer transfers injury to themselves partially"

      example:
        name: "Mend Wounds"
        limit: "Accelerates natural healing (days to hours, not instant)"
        cost: "Extreme fatigue for healer (one patient per day)"
        implication: "Field medics still needed. Prevention still better than cure."
      ```

      Test your magic system:
      1. What would a smart person exploit?
      2. What jobs become obsolete?
      3. Who would be rich/poor?
      4. How would wars be fought?

  - id: monoculture-worlds
    severity: HIGH
    title: Single-Trait Cultures Feel Shallow
    description: "The warrior race" or "the merchant people" reduces cultures to stereotypes
    symptoms:
      - All members of a group act identically
      - Cultures defined by single trait
      - Players predict every NPC from their race
      - World feels like a theme park

      Cultures Need Internal Diversity:

      **Bad:** "Dwarves are all smiths who live underground and hate elves."

      **Better:**
      ```yaml
      dwarven_culture:
        core_values:
          - Craftsmanship (but in many forms, not just metal)
          - Legacy (what you leave behind matters)
          - Honesty (oaths are sacred)

        internal_diversity:
          clans:
            stone_singers:
              specialty: "Architecture and stonework"
              values: "Patience, permanence"
              stereotype_among_others: "Boring, slow"

            iron_hearts:
              specialty: "Metalwork and weapons"
              values: "Precision, strength"
              stereotype_among_others: "Aggressive, proud"

            deep_seekers:
              specialty: "Mining and exploration"
              values: "Curiosity, bravery"
              stereotype_among_others: "Reckless, obsessed"

            gold_counters:
              specialty: "Trade and banking"
              values: "Fairness, profit"
              stereotype_among_others: "Greedy, cunning"

          tensions:
            - "Iron_hearts look down on gold_counters as 'not real dwarves'"
            - "Stone_singers and deep_seekers compete for resources"
            - "All clans have outcasts who rejected their traditions"

          historical_split:
            - "The Surface Dwarves left 500 years ago"
            - "Underground dwarves consider them lost, surface dwarves call them stubborn"

        relationship_with_elves:
          historical: "Ancient war over a betrayal (each side blames the other)"
          current: "Officially hostile, but individual friendships exist"
          generational: "Young dwarves question the feud, elders insist on it"
      ```

      Every culture should have:
      - At least 3-4 subgroups with different values
      - Internal tensions and debates
      - Individuals who don't fit the mold
      - Relationships that aren't monolithic

    severity: HIGH
    title: Historical Timelines Have Logical Holes
    description: Events don't follow cause-and-effect, technology doesn't progress
    symptoms:
      - Players find contradictions
      - "Why didn't they invent X if they had Y?"
      - Empires last impossibly long/short
      - Technology frozen for millennia
    detection_pattern: "history|timeline|age|era|year"
    solution: |
      Timeline Consistency Checklist:

      ```yaml
      validation_questions:
        technology:
          - "If they have metallurgy, why no agriculture?"
          - "If they have sailing, why haven't they explored X?"
          - "What prevents gunpowder/printing/steam?"

        politics:
          - "How does this empire maintain control over this distance?"
          - "Why hasn't anyone rebelled in 1000 years?"
          - "What prevents other empires from forming?"

        society:
          - "With this birthrate and death rate, what's the population?"
          - "How do they feed this many people?"
          - "What prevents social change over centuries?"

        magic:
          - "If magic exists, why didn't it change these events?"
          - "Why didn't the losing side use magic to win?"
          - "How does magic interact with technology development?"

      common_fixes:
        empire_too_long:
          problem: "Empire lasted 5000 years unchanged"
          fix: "Add cycles of decline and renewal, regional autonomy variations"

        tech_stagnation:
          problem: "Medieval tech for 10,000 years"
          fix: "Either accelerate timeline OR explain why (magic makes tech unnecessary,
                a cataclysm reset progress, religious prohibition)"

        population_math:
          problem: "Small village has supplied armies for centuries"
          fix: "Either increase village size, reduce army needs, or explain magic/breeding"

      realistic_duration_guidelines:
        dynasty: "3-10 generations (60-300 years)"
        empire: "200-500 years typical, 1000 max"
        religion: "Can last millennia but evolves dramatically"
        technology_era: "Accelerates over time (stone age: millions, information age: decades)"
        language: "Unrecognizable after ~500-1000 years without writing"

        resource_at_stake:
          type: "Trade route control + national identity"
          scarcity: "Only one mountain pass exists. Control means wealth."

        aldris_view:
          grievance: "The Cities were part of our empire. They rebelled."
          justification: "We built those cities. They owe us."
          fear: "If they stay free, other provinces will rebel."

        cities_view:
          grievance: "Aldris taxed us into poverty. We earned our freedom."
          justification: "We built our own wealth. The empire just took."
          fear: "If we lose, we go back to being exploited."

        complexity:
          moderates: "Aldris merchants who profit from trade, City nobles who want stability"
          extremists: "Aldris generals who want glory, City radicals who want revenge"
          victims: "Border farmers, refugees, children soldiers"
          profiteers: "Weapon merchants, mercenary companies, neighboring kingdoms"
