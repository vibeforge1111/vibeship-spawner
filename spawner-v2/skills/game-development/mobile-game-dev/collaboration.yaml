# ==============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ==============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Mobile App Development (Non-Game)
    insight: |
      Mobile app developers know that:
      - Users expect < 3 second load times
      - Offline capability is not optional
      - Push notifications drive engagement but can annoy
      - Background processing has strict limits
      Games should follow these same UX principles.
    applies_when: "Designing game startup, save/load, notifications"

  - domain: Embedded Systems
    insight: |
      Embedded developers understand resource constraints:
      - Fixed memory budgets are non-negotiable
      - Power consumption is a primary concern
      - Thermal management is critical
      - You must work within the hardware, not fight it
      Mobile games operate under similar constraints.
    applies_when: "Optimizing for memory and battery"

  - domain: Console Game Development
    insight: |
      Console developers know platform requirements:
      - Certification requirements are extensive
      - First-party guidelines must be followed exactly
      - Build times and iteration cycles matter
      - Platform features (achievements, cloud saves) are expected
      App Store submission is similar to console certification.
    applies_when: "Preparing for store submission"

  - domain: Web Performance Engineering
    insight: |
      Web performance engineers measure everything:
      - Time to First Meaningful Paint
      - Time to Interactive
      - Largest Contentful Paint
      Games need similar metrics: Time to Gameplay.
    applies_when: "Optimizing startup and loading"

  - domain: UX Research
    insight: |
      UX researchers understand mobile context:
      - Users are often distracted or multitasking
      - Sessions are frequently interrupted
      - One-handed use is common
      - Thumb reach zones matter
      Design games for the mobile context, not the ideal scenario.
    applies_when: "Designing touch input and UI layout"
