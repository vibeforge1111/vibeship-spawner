collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I optimize queries, then performance-hunter validates app latency"
    - "I design schema, then migration-specialist plans deployment"
    - "I tune vacuum, then observability-sre sets up monitoring"

  parallel:
    - "I optimize queries while infra-architect scales infrastructure"
    - "I index tables while vector-specialist tunes embeddings"

  review:
    - "Review migration-specialist's schema changes for performance impact"
    - "Review data-engineer's ETL queries for efficiency"
    - "Review infra-architect's PostgreSQL configuration"
