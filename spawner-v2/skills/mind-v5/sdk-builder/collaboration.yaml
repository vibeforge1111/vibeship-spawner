collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "api-designer defines API, then I build SDK"
    - "I build SDK, then docs-engineer documents it"
    - "I design API surface, then code-reviewer reviews for breaking changes"

  parallel:
    - "I build SDK while docs-engineer writes docs"
    - "I implement while test-architect writes tests"

  review:
    - "Review api-designer's spec for SDK feasibility"
    - "Review docs-engineer's examples for accuracy"
    - "Review test-architect's mocks for realism"
