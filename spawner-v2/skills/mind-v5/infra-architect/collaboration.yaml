collaboration_patterns:
  sequential:
    - "I deploy infrastructure, then observability-sre sets up monitoring"
    - "I create cluster, then postgres-wizard deploys database"
    - "I set up networking, then event-architect deploys Kafka"

  parallel:
    - "I optimize node pools while performance-hunter profiles apps"
    - "I update manifests while chaos-engineer prepares experiments"

  review:
    - "Review chaos-engineer's failure injection for infrastructure impact"
    - "Review migration-specialist's plan for infrastructure dependencies"
    - "Review security changes with privacy-guardian"
