  - id: god-node-performance
    summary: Single node with 100K+ edges brings queries to halt
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Your graph has a popular node - maybe a common entity like "United States"
      or a power user. Every query that touches it scans all edges. Response
      times go from milliseconds to minutes.
    why: |
      Graph databases optimize for traversal, not filtering. When you match
      on a god node, every edge must be examined. With 100K edges, that's
      100K operations per query. Compound with joins and it's game over.
    solution: |
      # Strategy 1: Partition by time window
      # Instead of: (user)-[:VISITED]->(location)
      # Use: (user)-[:VISITED_2024_Q1]->(location)

      # Strategy 2: Aggregate counts
      # Instead of: 1M edges from Entity->Mention
      # Use: (entity)-[:MENTIONED_IN {count: 1000000}]->(source_type)

      # Strategy 3: Hierarchical bucketing
      CREATE (e:Entity {name: "USA"})
      CREATE (e)-[:HAS_BUCKET]->(b:EntityBucket {range: "A-M"})
      CREATE (b)-[:CONTAINS]->(ref:Reference)

      # Strategy 4: Detect and alert
      async def check_cardinality(node_id):
          count = await graph.query(
              "MATCH (n)-[r]-() WHERE n.id = $id RETURN count(r)",
              {"id": node_id}
          )
          if count > 10000:
              alert(f"Node {node_id} approaching god node status: {count} edges")
    symptoms:
      - "Queries timeout on specific nodes"
      - "One query works fast, adding join makes it hang"
      - "Performance degrades as data grows"

  - id: falkordb-redis-memory
    summary: FalkorDB inherits Redis memory limits
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You're using FalkorDB (Redis-based graph database). Everything works in
      development. In production, with real data, writes start failing silently
      or the server OOMs.
    why: |
      FalkorDB runs as a Redis module. Redis keeps data in memory by default.
      Your graph is limited by available RAM. Unlike disk-based databases,
      you can't just "add more storage."
    solution: |
      # 1. Calculate memory requirements BEFORE choosing FalkorDB
      # Rule of thumb: 1M nodes + 10M edges ≈ 4-8 GB RAM

      # 2. Set Redis memory limits explicitly
      # redis.conf:
      maxmemory 16gb
      maxmemory-policy noeviction  # Don't silently drop data!

      # 3. Monitor memory usage
      async def check_graph_memory():
          info = await redis.info("memory")
          used = info["used_memory"]
          max_mem = info["maxmemory"]
          if used / max_mem > 0.8:
              alert("Graph memory at 80% capacity")

      # 4. Consider alternatives for large graphs
      # - Neo4j: Disk-based, larger datasets
      # - AWS Neptune: Managed, auto-scaling
      # - Keep FalkorDB for hot data, archive cold to disk
    symptoms:
      - "Write operations fail silently"
      - "Redis OOM killer terminates process"
      - "Graph operations slow as memory fills"
      - "Data loss after restart (if RDB disabled)"

  - id: cypher-cartesian-product
    summary: Multiple MATCH clauses create Cartesian products
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You write a query with multiple MATCH clauses to find connected patterns.
      Query works on small data, hangs forever on production data.
    why: |
      Separate MATCH clauses without shared variables create Cartesian products.
      If first MATCH returns 1000 rows and second returns 1000 rows, you get
      1,000,000 combinations. This grows exponentially with more MATCH clauses.
    solution: |
      // WRONG: Cartesian product (1000 x 1000 = 1M rows)
      MATCH (u:User)
      MATCH (m:Memory)
      WHERE u.id = m.user_id
      RETURN u, m

      // RIGHT: Connected pattern (1000 rows)
      MATCH (u:User)-[:HAS_MEMORY]->(m:Memory)
      RETURN u, m

      // RIGHT: If you must use separate MATCH, use WITH
      MATCH (u:User {id: $user_id})
      WITH u
      MATCH (u)-[:HAS_MEMORY]->(m:Memory)
      RETURN u, m

      // Use PROFILE to detect Cartesian products
      PROFILE MATCH (a:A) MATCH (b:B) RETURN a, b
      // Look for "CartesianProduct" in plan
    symptoms:
      - "Query works on dev, hangs on prod"
      - "Memory explodes during query"
      - "PROFILE shows CartesianProduct operator"
      - "Query time grows quadratically with data"

  - id: missing-temporal-validity
    summary: Adding time validity to edges after data exists is painful
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You build your graph with simple edges: (user)-[:KNOWS]->(entity).
      Later, you need to track when relationships started/ended. Migrating
      existing data is a nightmare.
    why: |
      Without temporal validity from the start, you can't answer "what did
      the user believe 6 months ago?" Retroactive addition requires scanning
      and updating every edge, often with guessed timestamps.
    solution: |
      // ALWAYS include temporal validity from day one
      CREATE (u:User)-[r:BELIEVES {
          valid_from: datetime(),
          valid_until: null,  // null = still valid
          created_at: datetime()
      }]->(e:Entity)

      // Expire relationship (never delete!)
      MATCH (u:User)-[r:BELIEVES]->(e:Entity)
      WHERE r.id = $edge_id
      SET r.valid_until = datetime()

      // Query historical state
      MATCH (u:User {id: $user_id})-[r:BELIEVES]->(e:Entity)
      WHERE r.valid_from <= $point_in_time
        AND (r.valid_until IS NULL OR r.valid_until > $point_in_time)
      RETURN e

      // If you must migrate:
      MATCH (u)-[r:KNOWS]->(e)
      WHERE r.valid_from IS NULL
      SET r.valid_from = r.created_at ?? datetime("2020-01-01"),
          r.valid_until = null
    symptoms:
      - "Can't answer 'what did they know on date X'"
      - "History lost when relationships updated"
      - "Audit requirements can't be met"
      - "Migration estimated in weeks"

  - id: entity-resolution-skipped
    summary: Graph becomes noise without entity resolution
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You extract entities from text and create nodes directly. "John Smith",
      "J. Smith", "John S.", and "Smith, John" become four separate nodes.
      Your graph becomes useless.
    why: |
      Entity resolution is 80% of knowledge graph work. Without it, you have
      disconnected fragments instead of a connected graph. Queries return
      partial results. Relationship counts are wrong.
    solution: |

  - id: optional-match-performance
    summary: OPTIONAL MATCH is surprisingly expensive
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You use OPTIONAL MATCH to include related data that might not exist.
      Query is much slower than expected.
    why: |
      OPTIONAL MATCH must attempt the match for every input row, even when
      there's no result. It can't short-circuit. Combined with large result
      sets, this creates significant overhead.
    solution: |
      // SLOW: OPTIONAL MATCH on every row
      MATCH (u:User {id: $user_id})-[:HAS_MEMORY]->(m:Memory)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:RELATES_TO]->(e:Entity)
      RETURN m, collect(e)

      // FASTER: Split into two queries when optional data rarely exists
      // Query 1: Get memories
      MATCH (u:User {id: $user_id})-[:HAS_MEMORY]->(m:Memory)
      RETURN m

      // Query 2: Get related entities for memories that have them

  - id: cycle-in-causal-graph
    summary: Cycles in causal graphs break inference
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Your causal graph has A->B->C->A. Inference algorithms go infinite.
      Counterfactual queries return nonsense.
    why: |
      Causal graphs must be DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). Cycles imply
      time travel (A causes B which causes A). Inference algorithms assume
      acyclicity for correctness.

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      You build Cypher queries with string formatting. Every unique value

    why: |
      Databases cache query plans for parameterized queries. String
