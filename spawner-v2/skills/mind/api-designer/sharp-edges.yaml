# API Designer Sharp Edges
# Production gotchas for API design

sharp_edges:
  - id: breaking-optional-to-required
    summary: Making optional field required breaks all clients
    severity: critical
    situation: Evolving API to require previously optional field
    why: |
      Clients built against old API don't send the field. Suddenly their
      requests fail with validation errors. Can't rollback without data loss
      if you already have new records requiring the field.
    solution: |
      1. Never make optional fields required
      2. If must require, version the API:
         - v1: field optional, default value used
         - v2: field required, migration path documented
      3. Add validation gradually:
         - Week 1: Log when field missing
         - Week 2: Return warning header
         - Week 3: Return error in new version only
      4. Provide migration guide and timeline
    symptoms:
      - Sudden spike in 400 errors after deployment
      - Client complaints "it worked yesterday"
      - Error: "field X is required"
    detection_pattern: 'required.*true|\.required\(\)|NotNull'

  - id: offset-pagination-drift
    summary: Offset pagination returns duplicates or skips items during writes
    severity: medium
    situation: Paginating through actively changing data
    why: |
      User is on page 3 (offset 200). New item is inserted at position 50.
      Page 3 now starts at what was page 3 item 2. User sees duplicate.
      Or item at position 199 is deleted. User skips an item entirely.
    solution: |
      1. Use cursor-based pagination:
         GET /items?after=item_abc&limit=100
      2. Cursor encodes position in stable ordering:
         {"created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z", "id": "item_abc"}
      3. Query uses cursor for consistent position:
         WHERE (created_at, id) > (:cursor_created_at, :cursor_id)
      4. If must use offset, accept the limitation and document it
    symptoms:
      - Duplicate items in paginated results
      - Missing items when iterating all pages
      - '"I saw this item already" user reports'
    detection_pattern: 'offset|page.*number|skip'

  - id: n-plus-one-includes
    summary: Include/expand parameters cause N+1 database queries
    severity: high
    situation: API supports including related resources
    why: |
      GET /memories?include=entities,relationships looks innocent.
      But if you fetch 100 memories, that's 100 queries for entities,
      100 queries for relationships. 201 queries instead of 3.
    solution: |
      1. Batch fetch included resources:
         memory_ids = [m.id for m in memories]
         entities = Entity.where(memory_id__in=memory_ids)
      2. Use DataLoader pattern for GraphQL
      3. Limit include depth:
         ?include=entities (ok)
         ?include=entities.mentions.users (too deep)
      4. Consider if you need includes at all - maybe separate endpoint
    symptoms:
      - Slow response with includes, fast without
      - Database CPU spike on list endpoints
      - Linear slowdown as page size increases
    detection_pattern: 'include=|expand=|embed='

  - id: unbounded-array-response
    summary: Endpoint returns array that can grow indefinitely
    severity: medium
    situation: List endpoint without pagination or limits
    why: |
      Today you have 100 memories. Works fine. Next year you have 10 million.
      Single request tries to return 10 million items. OOM, timeout, client crash.
    solution: |
      1. Always paginate list endpoints:
         GET /memories → GET /memories?limit=100
      2. Set server-side max limit:
         limit = min(request.limit, 1000)
      3. Return pagination info even on first page:
         {"data": [...], "pagination": {"has_more": true}}
      4. For truly unbounded, use streaming:
         Transfer-Encoding: chunked
         Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
    symptoms:
      - Timeout on list endpoints as data grows
      - Out of memory errors
      - Clients hanging on large accounts
    detection_pattern: 'limit|max.*results|pagination'

  - id: rate-limit-without-headers
    summary: Rate limiting without informative headers
    severity: medium
    situation: Implementing rate limiting
    why: |
      Client gets 429. How long to wait? How many requests left? No idea.
      Client either hammers retry (making it worse) or waits too long.
    solution: |
      1. Return standard rate limit headers:
         X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
         X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
         X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704067200  # Unix timestamp
      2. On 429, include Retry-After:
         HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
         Retry-After: 30
      3. Response body explains limit:
         {
           "error": {
             "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
             "message": "Rate limit exceeded. 1000 requests per hour.",
             "retry_after": 30
           }
         }
      4. Different limits for different endpoints (writes vs reads)
    symptoms:
      - Clients retry immediately on 429
      - Support tickets asking "why am I blocked?"
      - Clients implement arbitrary backoff
    detection_pattern: 'X-RateLimit|Retry-After|rate.*limit'

  - id: enum-evolution-breaking
    summary: Adding enum value breaks clients with strict parsing
    severity: medium
    situation: Evolving enum types over time
    why: |
      Client deserializes status into StatusEnum. You add new status "pending_review".
      Client's parser fails on unknown value. Client crashes or drops the record.
    solution: |
      1. Document that enums may grow - clients MUST handle unknown values
      2. Use "unknown" fallback in client SDKs:
         status = StatusEnum.from_str(value) or StatusEnum.UNKNOWN
      3. Consider strings instead of enums for extensibility
      4. Version API if adding enum value changes semantics
      5. Pre-announce new values before deploying:
         "New status 'pending_review' coming in 2 weeks"
    symptoms:
      - Client errors after adding enum value
      - '"Unknown enum value" errors in client logs'
      - Records disappearing from client apps
    detection_pattern: 'enum|status.*type|Literal\['

  - id: timestamp-timezone-chaos
    summary: Timestamp fields without timezone cause interpretation issues
    severity: medium
    situation: Returning datetime fields in API responses
    why: |
      "2024-01-15 10:30:00" - is that UTC? Server timezone? Client timezone?
      Client in Tokyo, server in NYC. They disagree by 14 hours.
    solution: |
      1. Always use ISO 8601 with timezone:
         "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"  # UTC
         "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00+09:00"  # With offset
      2. Prefer UTC for storage and API, convert for display
      3. Document timezone policy in API docs
      4. Accept timezone in input, normalize to UTC:
         Input: "2024-01-15T10:30:00+09:00"
         Stored: "2024-01-15T01:30:00Z"
    symptoms:
      - Events showing wrong time
      - '"This happened 8 hours ago" when it was just now'
      - Scheduling off by hours
    detection_pattern: 'datetime|timestamp|created_at|ISO.*8601'

  - id: graphql-depth-attack
    summary: Deeply nested GraphQL query exhausts resources
    severity: high
    situation: GraphQL API without query depth limits
    why: |
      query { user { friends { friends { friends { friends { ... } } } } } }
      Each level multiplies database queries. 10 levels deep with 100 friends
      each = 100^10 potential queries. DoS via legitimate-looking query.
    solution: |
      1. Limit query depth:
         # graphql-depth-limit
         depthLimit(5)
      2. Limit query complexity:
         # graphql-query-complexity
         complexityLimit(1000)
      3. Limit result size:
         first: 100  # max 100 items
      4. Timeout long-running queries
      5. Log and alert on expensive queries
    symptoms:
      - GraphQL server OOM
      - Extremely slow queries
      - Database connection exhaustion
    detection_pattern: 'depth.*limit|complexity|maxDepth'
