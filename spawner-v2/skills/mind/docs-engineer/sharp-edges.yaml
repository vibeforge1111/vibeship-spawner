# Documentation Engineer Sharp Edges
# Production gotchas for technical documentation

  - id: broken-examples
    summary: Code examples in docs don't actually work
    severity: critical
    situation: Publishing documentation with code samples
    why: |
      User copies example. Gets error. Loses trust immediately.
      "If the docs are wrong, what else is wrong?"
      One broken example destroys documentation credibility.
    solution: |
      1. Test examples automatically:
         # pytest-doctest runs examples from markdown
         pytest --doctest-modules docs/

      2. Use extract-and-run pattern:
         ```python
         # filename: examples/quickstart.py
         from mind import Agent
         agent = Agent("test")
         ```
         # CI runs all examples/*.py

      3. Use versioned examples:
         # Link examples to specific version
         # ```python <!-- mind==5.0.0 -->

      4. Add example to CI matrix:
         # Test examples against all supported Python versions
    symptoms:
      - User issues: "Example doesn't work"
      - ImportError, NameError in copied examples
      - Examples use deprecated APIs
    detection_pattern: 'example|sample.*code|```python'

  - id: version-drift
    summary: Docs describe old version, users run new version
    severity: high
    situation: Documentation not updated with releases
    why: |
      API changed in v5.2. Docs still show v5.0 patterns.
      User follows docs. Gets deprecation warnings or errors.
      "These docs are useless" - user goes to Stack Overflow instead.
    solution: |
      1. Version your docs:
         # docs.memory-service.io/v5.0/
         # docs.memory-service.io/v5.1/
         # docs.memory-service.io/latest/

      2. Include version badges:
         ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-5.0-blue)

      3. Add "since" annotations:
         ## `memory.consolidate()`
         _Available since v5.1_

      4. Require docs update in PR:
         # PR checklist: [ ] Docs updated
         # CI: Fail if public API changed without docs change
    symptoms:
      - "Docs say X but code does Y"
      - DeprecationWarning following docs
      - "This method doesn't exist" errors
    detection_pattern: 'version|deprecated|since|v[0-9]'

  - id: missing-error-docs
    summary: No docs for error messages or troubleshooting
    severity: medium
    situation: User gets error with no guidance
    why: |
      Error: "MemoryStoreFull". What does this mean? How do I fix it?
      User googles. No results. Creates issue. Waits for response.
      Good error docs prevent 50% of support tickets.
    solution: |
      1. Document every error code:
         # docs/errors/MEMORY_STORE_FULL.md
         ## Error: MEMORY_STORE_FULL

         ### What it means
         Your memory store has reached capacity.

         ### How to fix
         1. Consolidate old memories: `agent.consolidate()`
         2. Delete unused memories: `agent.forget(older_than=30)`
         3. Increase store size: `Agent(store_size="10GB")`

      2. Add troubleshooting section:
         ## Troubleshooting
         - [Installation issues](./troubleshooting/installation.md)
         - [Connection errors](./troubleshooting/connection.md)
         - [Performance problems](./troubleshooting/performance.md)

      3. Link errors to docs:
         raise MemoryStoreFullError(
             "Store is full. See: https://docs.mind/errors/MEMORY_STORE_FULL"
         )
    symptoms:
      - "What does this error mean?" issues
      - Same error questions asked repeatedly
      - Users stuck with no path forward
    detection_pattern: 'error|troubleshoot|FAQ|common.*issue'

  - id: no-getting-started
    summary: Docs dive into details without quick start
    severity: high
    situation: New user landing on documentation
    why: |
      User wants to try your library. Docs start with architecture.
      30 pages of concepts. No "how do I run this?" for 10 minutes.
      User leaves. Tries competitor with 5-line quick start.
    solution: |
      1. Quick start on first page:
         # Memory Service

         ```bash
         pip install memory-service
         ```

         ```python
         from mind import Agent
         agent = Agent("my-agent")
         await agent.remember("Hello, world!")
         ```

      2. Time estimate:
         # Quick Start (5 minutes)

      3. Immediate success:
         # First example should produce visible output

      4. Progressive disclosure:
         # Quick Start → Tutorial → Concepts → API Reference
    symptoms:
      - Users asking "how do I start?"
      - High bounce rate on docs homepage
      - Adoption lower than code quality deserves
    detection_pattern: 'quick.*start|getting.*started|installation'

  - id: copy-paste-unsafe
    summary: Examples work but have security/production issues
    severity: high
    situation: Users copy examples directly to production
    why: |
      Example uses hardcoded password for simplicity.
      User copies to production. Gets hacked.
      "But I followed the docs!"
    solution: |
      1. Use obvious placeholders:
         # BAD
         api_key = "sk-1234567890"

         # GOOD
         api_key = os.environ["MIND_API_KEY"]

      2. Add security warnings:
         ```python
         # ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT ONLY - Use secrets manager in production
         db_password = "localdevpassword"
         ```

      3. Show production pattern:
         ## Quick Start (Development)
         ```python
         agent = Agent("test")  # In-memory storage
         ```

         ## Production Setup
         ```python
         agent = Agent(
             "prod",
             storage=PostgresStorage(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"])
         )
         ```

      4. Separate dev and prod docs:
         # /docs/development/quickstart.md
         # /docs/production/deployment.md
    symptoms:
      - Security vulnerabilities from copied examples
      - Hardcoded credentials in production
      - "But the docs said to do this"
    detection_pattern: 'example|demo|development.*only|production'

  - id: dead-links
    summary: Documentation links lead to 404 pages
    severity: medium
    situation: Links to moved or deleted pages
    why: |
      User follows "See Advanced Usage" link. 404.
      Now they're lost. Trust in docs decreases.
      Common in growing docs with refactoring.
    solution: |
      1. Check links in CI:
         # markdown-link-check
         npx markdown-link-check docs/**/*.md

      2. Use relative links:
         # BAD: Will break if domain changes
         [API](https://docs.memory-service.io/api)

         # GOOD: Relative to current doc
         [API](./api/index.md)

      3. Add redirects for moved pages:
         # In docs config
         redirects:
           - from: /old/path
             to: /new/path

      4. Periodic link audit:
         # Monthly: run link checker on production docs
    symptoms:
      - 404 errors in docs
      - "Link doesn't work" issues
      - Users can't find referenced content
    detection_pattern: 'link|href|url|see.*also'

  - id: no-search
    summary: Can't find anything in docs without reading everything
    severity: medium
    situation: Large documentation without search
    why: |
      User knows feature exists but can't find docs.
      Scrolls through 50 pages. Gives up. Asks on Discord.
      Good search is the difference between docs and a book.
    solution: |
      1. Add search (Algolia, Typesense, Meilisearch):
         # docsearch.algolia.com for free OSS indexing

      2. Use semantic organization:
         # Group by user task, not by code structure
         - Getting Started
         - Storing Memories
         - Retrieving Memories
         - Configuration

      3. Add keyword synonyms:
         # "login", "signin", "authentication" → same page

      4. Include common searches in nav:
         # Most visited: Installation, Quick Start, API Reference
    symptoms:
      - "Where are the docs for X?"
      - Users can't find existing documentation
      - Support questions for documented features
    detection_pattern: 'search|find|navigation|index'
