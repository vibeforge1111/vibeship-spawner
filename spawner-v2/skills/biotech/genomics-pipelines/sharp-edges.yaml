    severity: critical
    title: "Using DNA Aligner for RNA-seq Reads"
    summary: "BWA/Bowtie cannot handle spliced alignments - massive read loss"
    symptoms:
      - "Low mapping rate (30-50%) for RNA-seq"
      - "Most reads reported as unmapped"
      - "Differential expression analysis fails"
    why: |
      RNA-seq reads span exon-exon junctions. DNA aligners like BWA and Bowtie
      expect contiguous genomic sequences. When a read crosses a splice junction,
      the DNA aligner sees a ~10kb "deletion" (the intron) and fails to map.

      You'll lose 40-70% of your reads, especially from multi-exon genes.
    gotcha: |
      # WRONG - DNA aligner for RNA-seq
      bwa mem GRCh38.fa sample_R1.fq sample_R2.fq > aligned.sam
      # Result: 35% mapping rate, lost most exon-junction reads

      # WRONG - Bowtie2 for RNA-seq
      bowtie2 -x genome -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq -S aligned.sam
      # Same problem - no splice awareness
    solution: |
      # CORRECT - Use splice-aware aligner
      STAR --genomeDir star_index \
           --readFilesIn reads_1.fq reads_2.fq \
           --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate

      # Or HISAT2 (lower memory)
      hisat2 -x genome_index -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq -S aligned.sam

  - id: wrong-duplicate-handling
    severity: critical
    title: "Incorrect Duplicate Handling for Data Type"
    summary: "Marking duplicates wrong for RNA-seq or amplicon data"
    symptoms:
      - "RNA-seq: Massive loss of reads from highly expressed genes"
      - "Amplicon: All reads marked as duplicates"
      - "Zero coverage in target regions"
    why: |
      Duplicate marking assumes random fragmentation. This assumption is:
      - TRUE for WGS/WES: Duplicates are PCR artifacts
      - FALSE for RNA-seq: Same position = same transcript molecule
      - FALSE for amplicon: Same position = same target by design

      Marking duplicates in RNA-seq removes biological signal.
      Marking duplicates in amplicon removes ALL your data.
    gotcha: |
      # DANGEROUS for RNA-seq
      picard MarkDuplicates I=rna_aligned.bam O=marked.bam ...
      # Result: 80% of reads from highly-expressed genes removed

      # CATASTROPHIC for amplicon
      picard MarkDuplicates I=amplicon.bam O=marked.bam ...
      # Result: 99% of reads removed, no coverage
    solution: |
      # RNA-seq: Skip duplicate marking OR use UMIs
      # If you have UMIs:
      umi_tools dedup -I aligned.bam -O deduped.bam --method=unique

      # Amplicon: NEVER mark duplicates
      # Use molecular barcodes/UMIs if deduplication is needed

      # WGS/WES: Duplicate marking is correct
      picard MarkDuplicates I=wgs_aligned.bam O=marked.bam M=metrics.txt

  - id: contig-name-mismatch
    severity: critical
    title: "Reference Contig Name Mismatch"
    summary: "chr1 vs 1 mismatch causes zero reads in output"
    symptoms:
      - "Aligned BAM has reads, but variant caller finds nothing"
      - "No reads overlap with annotation"
      - "BED file intersection returns empty"
    why: |
      UCSC uses 'chr1', Ensembl/NCBI uses '1'.
      If your reference uses 'chr1' but your VCF/BED uses '1',
      NO coordinates will match. The tools won't warn you - they'll
      just return empty results silently.
    gotcha: |
      # Reference genome: chr1, chr2, ... (UCSC style)
      # Your BED file: 1, 2, ... (Ensembl style)

      bedtools intersect -a aligned.bam -b targets.bed
      # Returns: NOTHING (silently)
    solution: |
      # Always check contig names match
      # In BAM:
      samtools view -H aligned.bam | grep "^@SQ"

      # In BED/VCF:
      head -1 targets.bed

      # Convert if needed:
      sed 's/^chr//' ucsc_style.bed > ensembl_style.bed
      # or
      sed 's/^/chr/' ensembl_style.bed > ucsc_style.bed

      # Best: Use consistent references from the start

  - id: ignoring-strandedness
    severity: high
    title: "Ignoring Library Strandedness in RNA-seq"
    summary: "Wrong strand parameter halves your counts or doubles them"
    symptoms:
      - "Gene counts are ~50% of expected"
      - "Antisense genes show unexpected expression"
      - "Same gene shows counts on both strands"
    why: |
      Most RNA-seq protocols are stranded (dUTP, TruSeq Stranded).
      If you quantify with the wrong strand parameter:
      - Unstranded mode: Counts both strands (double counting)
      - Wrong strand: Counts antisense (50% loss, wrong genes)
    gotcha: |
      # Sample is TruSeq Stranded (reverse strand)
      # You run:
      featureCounts -s 0 ...  # Unstranded - WRONG
      # Result: Double counting, antisense contamination

      featureCounts -s 1 ...  # Forward strand - WRONG
      # Result: 50% of expected counts
    solution: |
      # Detect strandedness with RSeQC
      infer_experiment.py -i aligned.bam -r genes.bed

      # Common library types:
      # TruSeq Stranded: -s 2 (reverse)
      # SMARTer: -s 1 (forward)
      # Unstranded: -s 0

      # For Salmon:
      salmon quant ... -l A  # Auto-detect (recommended)

  - id: no-multimapping-strategy
    severity: high
    title: "No Strategy for Multi-Mapping Reads"
    summary: "Randomly assigning or ignoring multi-mappers loses information"
    symptoms:
      - "Gene families show inconsistent expression"
      - "Repetitive regions have zero coverage"
      - "Quantification is unstable between runs"
    why: |
      10-30% of reads map to multiple locations (paralogs, gene families,
      transposons). Default is often to assign randomly or discard.

      Random assignment: Different results each run
      Discarding: Lose information about gene families
    solution: |
      # Option 1: Probabilistic assignment (RECOMMENDED)
      # Salmon and RSEM use EM algorithm
      salmon quant --seqBias --gcBias ...

      # Option 2: Report all alignments, handle downstream
      STAR --outSAMmultNmax -1 --outSAMprimaryFlag AllBestScore ...

      # Option 3: Count fractionally
      featureCounts -M --fraction ...  # 1/N weight per location

  - id: mixing-genome-versions
    severity: critical
    title: "Mixing Genome Versions (GRCh37 vs GRCh38)"
    summary: "Coordinates don't match between files from different assemblies"
    symptoms:
      - "Known variants not found at expected positions"
      - "Annotation file has different chromosome lengths"
      - "VCF coordinates don't match reference"
    why: |
      GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh38 (hg38) have different coordinates.
      A variant at chr1:1000000 in GRCh37 might be at chr1:1060000 in GRCh38.

      Mixing versions creates silent failures - tools won't crash,
      they'll just give wrong results.
    gotcha: |
      # Reference: GRCh38
      bwa mem GRCh38.fa reads.fq > aligned.bam

      # Known sites: GRCh37 (OOPS!)
      gatk BaseRecalibrator \
          -R GRCh38.fa \
          --known-sites dbsnp_grch37.vcf  # WRONG VERSION
      # Result: Almost no known sites found, poor BQSR
    solution: |
      # Always verify genome version
      # Check chromosome lengths (they differ between versions)

      # If you need to convert coordinates:
      # Use UCSC liftOver or CrossMap
      CrossMap.py vcf hg19ToHg38.chain grch37.vcf GRCh38.fa grch38.vcf

      # Best practice: Document genome version in all filenames
      sample_GRCh38.bam

  - id: insufficient-coverage
    severity: high
    title: "Insufficient Sequencing Depth for Analysis Type"
    summary: "Too few reads to detect variants or differential expression"
    symptoms:
      - "Rare variants not detected"
      - "High false negative rate"
      - "Differential expression has no significant genes"
    why: |
      Different analyses need different depths:
      - WGS germline: 30x minimum
      - WES: 100x on target
      - Somatic variants: 100-500x
      - RNA-seq DE: 20-30M reads per sample
      - Single-cell: Varies by application

      Under-sequenced data gives false negatives, not errors.
    solution: |
      # Check coverage before analysis
      samtools depth -a aligned.bam | \
          awk '{sum+=$3} END {print "Average coverage:", sum/NR}'

      # For WGS: Should be >30x
      # For WES: Check on-target coverage (>100x)
      # For RNA-seq: Count total mapped reads

      # If insufficient:
      # 1. Sequence more (if possible)
      # 2. Use methods designed for low-coverage data
      # 3. Report as limitation
