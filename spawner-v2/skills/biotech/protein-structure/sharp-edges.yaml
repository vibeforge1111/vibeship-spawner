    title: "Treating Low-Confidence Regions as Structured"
    summary: "Interpreting pLDDT < 50 regions as real structures, not disorder"
    symptoms:
      - "Publishing figures showing loops with pLDDT < 50"
      - "Docking ligands to low-confidence binding sites"
      - "Making functional claims about disordered regions"
    why: |
      AlphaFold2 predicts EVERYTHING as some structure, even intrinsically
      disordered regions. pLDDT < 50 indicates the model has no confidence
      in the structure - it's essentially random.

      These regions are likely:
      - Intrinsically disordered (no stable structure exists)
      - Flexible linkers between domains
      - Regions that only fold upon binding

      Treating them as structured leads to wrong conclusions and
      wasted experimental effort.
    gotcha: |
      # Paper shows "novel loop structure" at residues 120-150
      # But pLDDT for this region is 35-45
      # There IS no structure - it's just what the model guessed

      # Docking to predicted "binding pocket"
      docking_site = residues_120_150  # pLDDT < 50
      # These residues probably don't maintain this conformation!
    solution: |
      # Always check pLDDT before interpreting structure
      def is_structured_region(plddt_scores, start, end, threshold=70):
          region_plddt = plddt_scores[start:end]
          return np.mean(region_plddt) >= threshold

      # Visualize by confidence
      # Blue (>90): Trust it
      # Light blue (70-90): Probably correct
      # Yellow (50-70): Uncertain
      # Red (<50): Likely disordered - DON'T INTERPRET

      # For disordered regions, report them as such:
      "Residues 120-150 are predicted to be disordered (mean pLDDT = 42)"

    severity: critical
    title: "Trusting Relative Domain Orientation Without Checking PAE"
    summary: "Multi-domain predictions often have correct domains but wrong orientation"
    symptoms:
      - "Using predicted inter-domain contacts for experimental design"
      - "Claiming domain-domain interactions from prediction"
      - "Docking based on predicted domain arrangement"
    why: |
      AlphaFold2 can predict individual domains accurately while completely
      failing at their relative orientation. Each domain might have pLDDT > 90,
      but the angle between them could be arbitrary.

      The PAE (Predicted Aligned Error) matrix reveals this:
      - Blue on diagonal = confident domains
      - Red between domains = uncertain orientation

      This is especially problematic for:
      - Multi-domain proteins with flexible linkers
      - Protein complexes
      - Proteins with domain rearrangements
    gotcha: |
      # Protein has two domains, both with pLDDT > 85
      # But PAE between domains is > 20 Angstrom
      # The relative orientation is essentially random!

      # Wrong conclusion:
      "Domain A contacts domain B at interface X"

      # Reality:
      "Domain A and B structures are reliable, but their
       relative orientation is unknown"
    solution: |
      # Always check PAE matrix for multi-domain proteins
      def check_domain_confidence(pae_matrix, domain1_range, domain2_range):
          inter_domain_pae = pae_matrix[
              domain1_range[0]:domain1_range[1],
              domain2_range[0]:domain2_range[1]
          ]
          mean_pae = np.mean(inter_domain_pae)

          if mean_pae > 15:
              return "UNRELIABLE: Domain orientation uncertain"
          elif mean_pae > 10:
              return "CAUTION: Some uncertainty in orientation"
          else:
              return "CONFIDENT: Domain orientation likely correct"

      # For uncertain orientations:
      # 1. Analyze domains separately
      # 2. Use experimental data (SAXS, crosslinking) to constrain
      # 3. Sample multiple conformations

    severity: high
    title: "Over-Trusting Protein Complex Predictions"
    summary: "Complex predictions are less reliable than monomer predictions"
    symptoms:
      - "Using AF-Multimer for novel interaction discovery"
      - "Trusting interface residues without experimental validation"
      - "Missing false positive interactions"
    why: |
      AF-Multimer can predict complexes, but:
      - Training was mostly on known complexes
      - False positives: Predicts complexes that don't exist
      - Interface accuracy varies widely
      - Stoichiometry must be known in advance

      The ipTM score helps but isn't definitive.
      Experimental validation is essential.
    gotcha: |
      # AF-Multimer predicts A-B complex with ipTM = 0.6
      # Conclusion: "A and B interact"
      # But 0.6 ipTM doesn't guarantee real interaction!

      # Wrong stoichiometry input:
      predict_complex(["A", "B"])  # Assumes 1:1
      # Reality might be 2:1 or transient
    solution: |
      # Complex prediction best practices:
      # 1. Only predict complexes with experimental evidence of interaction
      # 2. ipTM > 0.8 for high confidence
      # 3. Check interface makes biological sense
      # 4. Validate key residues experimentally

      def assess_complex_confidence(iptm, interface_pae):
          if iptm >= 0.8 and interface_pae < 10:
              return "HIGH - likely accurate"
          elif iptm >= 0.6:
              return "MEDIUM - validate interface"
          else:
              return "LOW - don't trust without validation"

  - id: membrane-protein-issues
    severity: high
    title: "Membrane Protein Predictions Without Context"
    summary: "AlphaFold doesn't model membrane environment"
    symptoms:
      - "Transmembrane helices in wrong orientation"
      - "Lipid-facing residues shown as solvent-exposed"
      - "Missing membrane-induced conformational effects"
    why: |
      AlphaFold2 predicts membrane proteins as if in water.
      This means:
      - Membrane orientation may be inverted
      - Lipid-exposed surfaces are treated like water-exposed
      - Conformational changes requiring membrane are missed

      The structure may be "correct" but unusable for
      membrane-related questions.
    solution: |
      # Post-processing for membrane proteins:
      # 1. Predict topology with TOPCONS or DeepTMHMM
      # 2. Orient structure in membrane with PPM server
      # 3. Consider membrane effects on dynamics

      # Use specialized membrane predictors when available
      # Or integrate with experimental membrane data

  - id: glycoprotein-missing-glycans
    severity: medium
    title: "Glycoprotein Predictions Missing Glycosylation"
    summary: "AlphaFold doesn't predict glycans attached to proteins"
    symptoms:
      - "Using unglycosylated model for antibody epitope prediction"
      - "Missing glycan shield effects"
      - "Surface accessibility calculations wrong"
    why: |
      AlphaFold2 predicts the protein chain only.
      Glycans can:
      - Block antibody access (glycan shield)
      - Stabilize protein structure
      - Be essential for function

      The "bare" model may be misleading for glycoproteins.
    solution: |
      # Check glycosylation sites
      # N-glycosylation: N-X-S/T motif
      # O-glycosylation: No clear motif

      # Add glycans computationally:
      # - GlyProt server
      # - CHARMM-GUI Glycan Reader

      # Report glycan sites:
      "Note: N120 is a known glycosylation site; glycan not modeled"

  - id: single-conformation-assumption
    severity: high
    title: "Assuming Single Conformation Represents All States"
    summary: "Proteins exist in conformational ensembles, not single structures"
    symptoms:
      - "Claiming active site is 'closed' based on prediction"
      - "Missing allosteric conformational changes"
      - "Failing to sample alternative states"
    why: |
      AlphaFold2 typically predicts the most stable/common conformation.
      Proteins often have:
      - Open/closed states
      - Ligand-induced changes
      - Allosteric conformations
      - Breathing motions

      A single model doesn't capture this dynamics.
    solution: |
      # Sample multiple conformations
      config = PredictionConfig(
          num_models=5,
          num_recycles=[1, 3, 6, 12],  # Different depths
          dropout=True  # Enable for diversity
      )

      # Compare models for conformational diversity
      # Use molecular dynamics for ensemble generation
      # Integrate with experimental ensemble data
