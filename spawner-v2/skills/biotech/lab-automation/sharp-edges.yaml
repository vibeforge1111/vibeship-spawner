    severity: high
    title: "Edge Effects in Multi-Well Plates"
    summary: "Edge wells have different evaporation rates causing systematic bias"
    symptoms:
      - "Outer wells show different results than inner wells"
      - "Controls in corners always fail/succeed"
      - "Assay CV improves when excluding edge wells"
    why: |
      Edge wells have more surface area exposed to air.
      This causes:
      - Faster evaporation (volume decreases)
      - Temperature differences
      - Different gas exchange

      In cell assays: edge cells grow differently.
      In enzyme assays: concentrations drift.

      The effect is worse for:
      - Long incubations
      - Small volumes
      - Non-sealed plates
    gotcha: |
      # Putting critical controls in A1, A12, H1, H12
      controls = ['A1', 'A12', 'H1', 'H12']  # Worst positions!

      # Not accounting for evaporation in kinetic reads
      # First timepoint vs last timepoint: 10% volume difference

      # Using edge wells for standard curve
      standard_wells = plate.rows()[0]  # All edge wells!
    solution: |
      # Keep controls and critical samples away from edges
      def get_inner_wells(plate, margin=1):
          """Get non-edge wells for critical samples."""
          return [
              well for well in plate.wells()
              if (margin <= well.row <= 7 - margin and
                  margin <= well.column <= 11 - margin)
          ]

      # Use edge wells for buffer or non-critical blanks
      edge_wells = ['A1', 'A12', 'H1', 'H12']
      # Fill with media to reduce evaporation

      # Seal plates for long incubations
      # Use humidity chambers

      # Include edge-effect controls and correct computationally

  - id: tip-contamination
    severity: critical
    title: "Cross-Contamination from Tip Reuse"
    summary: "Reusing tips between different samples causes carryover"
    symptoms:
      - "Positive samples in wells that should be negative"
      - "Gradient of signal across plate"
      - "PCR shows unexpected bands"
    why: |
      Tips retain residual liquid even after dispensing.
      Carryover is typically 0.01-0.1% of aspirated volume.

      For PCR: 0.01% carryover of 10^8 copies = 10^4 copies
      That's enough to give a strong false positive!

      For compound screening:
      Potent compound carryover can inhibit neighboring wells.
    gotcha: |
      # Aspirating different samples with same tip
      p300.aspirate(100, sample_a)
      p300.dispense(100, dest_1)
      p300.aspirate(100, sample_b)  # Same tip! Contamination!
      p300.dispense(100, dest_2)

      # Reusing tips for "similar" samples
      for sample in samples:
          p300.transfer(100, sample, dest, new_tip='never')
    solution: |
      # Change tips between different samples
      for sample in samples:
          p300.transfer(100, sample, dest, new_tip='always')

      # For same reagent to multiple wells, use multi-dispense
      p300.pick_up_tip()
      p300.aspirate(200, reagent)
      for well in wells:
          p300.dispense(25, well)  # Same tip OK for same reagent
      p300.drop_tip()

      # For PCR/qPCR: Always new tips, work low-to-high concentration
      # Add positive controls LAST

  - id: dead-volume-loss
    severity: high
    title: "Dead Volume Causing Insufficient Reagent"
    summary: "Reservoir dead volume leaves less reagent than calculated"
    symptoms:
      - "Last wells get no reagent"
      - "Pipette aspirates air"
      - "Protocol fails at end of run"
    why: |
      Reservoirs have minimum aspiratable volume (dead volume):
      - 12-channel reservoir: 3-5 mL per channel
      - 96-well plate: 20-50 µL per well
      - Tubes: 50-200 µL depending on geometry

      If you calculate exactly N × volume needed,
      you'll run out before the last sample.
    gotcha: |
      # Need 100 µL × 96 wells = 9.6 mL
      reagent_needed = 100 * 96  # 9600 µL
      # But reservoir dead volume is 3 mL
      # Actually need: 9600 + 3000 = 12600 µL

      # Protocol runs out at well 72!
    solution: |
      def calculate_reagent_with_dead_volume(
          volume_per_well: float,
          num_wells: int,
          dead_volume: float,
          extra_percent: float = 10
      ) -> float:
          """Calculate total reagent needed including dead volume."""
          working_volume = volume_per_well * num_wells
          extra = working_volume * (extra_percent / 100)
          total = working_volume + extra + dead_volume
          return total

      # Example
      reagent = calculate_reagent_with_dead_volume(
          volume_per_well=100,
          num_wells=96,
          dead_volume=3000,  # 3 mL reservoir dead volume
          extra_percent=10   # 10% extra for safety
      )
      # Result: 13560 µL needed

  - id: viscous-liquid-errors
    severity: high
    title: "Inaccurate Dispensing of Viscous Liquids"
    summary: "Standard settings fail for glycerol, DMSO, or serum"
    symptoms:
      - "Droplet hangs on tip after dispense"
      - "Short dispense - less volume than expected"
      - "Inconsistent volumes between wells"
    why: |
      Viscous liquids:
      - Take longer to fill tips (incomplete aspiration)
      - Don't detach from tip easily (short dispense)
      - Have different density (volume vs mass mismatch)

      Standard pipetting assumes water-like liquids.
      Using these settings for glycerol causes 10-30% error.
    gotcha: |
      # Dispensing DMSO with standard water settings
      p300.aspirate(100, dmso_stock)  # Too fast, air bubble
      p300.dispense(100, dest)  # Droplet hangs on tip

      # Not accounting for density
      # 100 µL glycerol ≈ 126 mg (density 1.26)
      # 100 µL water = 100 mg
    solution: |
      # Slow aspiration for viscous liquids
      VISCOUS_SETTINGS = {
          'aspirate_rate': 50,   # µL/s (vs 150 for water)
          'dispense_rate': 50,
          'delay_after_aspirate': 2.0,  # seconds
          'delay_after_dispense': 2.0,
          'blow_out': True,
          'touch_tip': True
      }

      def transfer_viscous(pipette, source, dest, volume):
          pipette.aspirate(volume, source, rate=0.3)
          pipette.delay(seconds=2)
          pipette.touch_tip(source)
          pipette.dispense(volume, dest, rate=0.3)
          pipette.delay(seconds=2)
          pipette.blow_out(dest.top())
          pipette.touch_tip(dest)

      # Pre-wet tips for viscous liquids
      # Use reverse pipetting for high accuracy

  - id: temperature-volume-drift
    severity: medium
    title: "Temperature-Dependent Volume Changes"
    summary: "Cold reagents have different volume than at calibration temperature"
    symptoms:
      - "Volumes off when using cold reagents"
      - "Assay results drift as reagents warm up"
      - "First and last wells differ systematically"
    why: |
      Pipettes are calibrated at room temperature (20-25°C).
      Water expands ~0.02% per °C.

      At 4°C vs 25°C: ~0.4% volume difference
      Seems small but compounds across many steps.

      Also: Cold air is denser, affects air displacement.
    solution: |
      # Allow reagents to equilibrate before use
      # Note in protocol: "Equilibrate to RT for 30 min"

      # For critical applications:
      # - Calibrate pipettes at working temperature
      # - Use gravimetric verification

      # Keep reagent plates on temp-controlled deck
      temp_module = protocol.load_module('temperature module gen2', '7')
      temp_module.set_temperature(25)  # Match calibration temp

  - id: barcode-scan-failures
    severity: high
    title: "Barcode Reading Failures Breaking Workflow"
    summary: "Smudged or missing barcode stops entire automation"
    symptoms:
      - "Protocol stops waiting for barcode"
      - "Wrong plate processed (barcode mixup)"
      - "LIMS records don't match physical plates"
    why: |
      Barcodes fail when:
      - Label is smudged or damaged
      - Plate rotated 180° (barcode on wrong side)
      - Wrong barcode type for reader
      - Condensation obscures barcode

      Without fallback, entire workflow stops.
    solution: |
      # Implement retry and fallback
      def scan_with_retry(scanner, max_retries=3):
          for attempt in range(max_retries):
              barcode = scanner.read()
              if barcode:
                  return barcode
              # Prompt user
              if attempt == max_retries - 1:

          return None
