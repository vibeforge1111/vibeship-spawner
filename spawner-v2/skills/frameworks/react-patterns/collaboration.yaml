# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Functional Programming
    insight: |
      FP experts know composition:
      - Pure functions are predictable
      - Composition beats inheritance
      - Immutability prevents bugs
      - Side effects are contained
      React follows functional principles.
    applies_when: "Designing components"

  - domain: State Machines
    insight: |
      State machine experts know transitions:
      - Finite states are manageable
      - Transitions are explicit
      - Invalid states are impossible
      - Events drive changes
      Complex state follows state machine patterns.
    applies_when: "Managing complex state"
