  - id: blame-culture
    summary: Postmortems become punishment sessions
    severity: high
    situation: People fear postmortems, hide information
    why: |
      Leadership wants accountability.
      "Someone must be responsible."
      Fear drives hiding.
    solution: |
      ## Building Blameless Culture

      ### Signs of Blame Culture

      | Sign | Impact |
      |------|--------|
      | People defensive | Hide information |
      | Naming names | Fear of error |
      | "Who did this" | Avoid responsibility |
      | Consequences for errors | Under-reporting |
      | Shame in meetings | Silence |

      ### Shifting the Culture

      ```
      LEADERSHIP ACTIONS:

      1. Model blamelessness
         - Leaders admit their mistakes first
         - Thank people for sharing failures

      2. Reward transparency
         - Celebrate finding problems
         - Promote people who surface issues

      3. Change the language
         - "What happened" not "who"
         - "System allowed" not "person caused"
      ```

      ### The Just Culture Model

      | Behavior | Response |
      |----------|----------|
      | Human error | Console, learn |
      | At-risk behavior | Coach, fix system |
      | Reckless behavior | Rare, address directly |

      ### Meeting Facilitation

      | If you hear... | Redirect with... |
      |----------------|------------------|
      | "John broke it" | "What allowed this to happen?" |
      | "Should have known" | "What could have surfaced this?" |
      | "Careless" | "What pressure led to this?" |
      | "Obviously wrong" | "What made it seem right at the time?" |
    symptoms:
      - Quiet postmortem meetings
      - Defensive responses
      - Under-reporting incidents
      - Fear of admitting error
    detection_pattern: "who did|their fault|should have|how could they"

  - id: postmortem-fatigue
    summary: Too many postmortems, no action
    severity: medium
    situation: Team burned out on incident review
    why: |
      Every small thing gets postmortem.
      Actions don't get done.
      Feels like bureaucracy.
    solution: |
      ## Sustainable Postmortem Practice

      ### When to Postmortem

      | Criteria | Postmortem? |
      |----------|-------------|
      | Customer impact | Yes |
      | Data loss risk | Yes |
      | Near miss (could have been bad) | Yes |
      | Novel failure mode | Yes |
      | Minor, known issue | No |
      | Quick recovery, no impact | Maybe light |

      ### Tiered Response

      | Tier | Criteria | Response |
      |------|----------|----------|
      | Major | Significant impact | Full postmortem, review meeting |
      | Minor | Limited impact | Quick doc, async review |
      | Near miss | Caught before impact | Brief analysis, shared learning |

      ### Completing the Loop

      ```
      THE COMPLETION PROBLEM:

      - 100 postmortems written
      - 1000 action items created
      - 50 action items done
      - Same incidents keep happening

      FIX:
      - Fewer, better actions
      - Track completion rate
      - Review monthly
      - Block next postmortem if actions undone
      ```

      ### Keeping It Fresh

      | Tactic | Why |
      |--------|-----|
      | Rotate facilitators | Different perspectives |
      | Vary formats | Prevent staleness |
      | Celebrate learnings | Positive association |
      | Share wins | Show value of process |
    symptoms:
      - "Not another postmortem"
      - Actions never done
      - Copy-paste documents
      - Going through motions
    detection_pattern: "do we have to|waste of time|nothing changes|same as last"

  - id: shallow-root-cause
    summary: Analysis stops at obvious cause
    severity: high
    situation: Same types of incidents keep recurring
    why: |
      Time pressure.
      Obvious answer feels sufficient.
      Deeper analysis is hard.
    solution: |
      ## Getting to Real Root Causes

      ### The Layers of Cause

      ```
      SURFACE:
      "Someone deployed bad code"

      DEEPER:
      "Tests didn't catch the bug"

      DEEPER:
      "This code path isn't tested"

      DEEPER:
      "No requirement for test coverage"

      ROOT:
      "Culture doesn't prioritize testing"
      ```

      ### Signs You Stopped Too Early

      | Sign | What to do |
      |------|------------|
      | "Human error" is the cause | Ask why error was possible |
      | One-word cause | Expand to system level |
      | Could recur easily | Dig deeper |
      | No systemic change | Find the pattern |

      ### The "Why" Continuation

      ```
      KEEP ASKING:

      "Why was that possible?"
      "What would have caught that?"
      "What pressure led to that?"
      "What system allowed that?"
      "What would prevent next time?"
      ```

      ### Systemic Root Causes

      | Surface Cause | System Cause |
      |---------------|--------------|
      | Wrong config | No validation |
      | Missed step | No checklist |
      | Slow response | No alerting |
      | Wrong decision | Missing context |
      | Time pressure | Understaffed |
    symptoms:
      - Recurring incident types
      - "We fixed this before"
      - Quick postmortems
      - Actions are band-aids
    detection_pattern: "happened again|same as before|didn't we fix|again"

  - id: action-theater
    summary: Actions look good but don't prevent recurrence
    severity: medium
    situation: Actions completed but incidents continue
    why: |
      Actions are easy not effective.
      No verification of effectiveness.
      Box-checking mentality.
    solution: |
      ## Effective Action Items

      ### Action Quality Check

      | Question | If No |
      |----------|-------|
      | Does this prevent exact recurrence? | Strengthen it |
      | Is this measurable? | Make it specific |
      | Can we verify it worked? | Add success criteria |
      | Will it actually get done? | Simplify |

      ### Types of Weak Actions

      | Weak | Strong |
      |------|--------|
      | "Improve monitoring" | "Add X alert with Y threshold" |
      | "Be more careful" | "Add validation step that catches X" |
      | "Review process" | "Add checklist with specific items" |
      | "Train team" | "Runbook for X scenario" |

      ### Verification Process

      ```
      30 DAYS AFTER COMPLETION:

      1. Did the action get done?
      2. Is it still in place?
      3. Has the problem recurred?
      4. Did it create new issues?
      5. Is it actually effective?
      ```

      ### The Recurrence Test

      | If same incident happens | Then |
      |--------------------------|------|
      | Actions not done | Accountability issue |
      | Actions done but failed | Actions were wrong |
      | New variation | Pattern to address |
    symptoms:
      - Actions done, incidents continue
      - "We did everything"
      - Band-aid solutions
      - Checkbox mentality
    detection_pattern: "but we fixed|action was done|still happening|what went wrong"
