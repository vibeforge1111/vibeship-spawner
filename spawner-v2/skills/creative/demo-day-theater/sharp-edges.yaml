# Demo Day Theater Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: live-demo-disaster
    summary: Demo fails catastrophically in front of stakeholders
    severity: high
    situation: Everything breaks during the presentation
    why: |
      No backup prepared.
      Demoed on unstable environment.
      Didn't test the demo itself.
    solution: |
      ## Recovering From Demo Disasters

      ### Prevention (Before)

      ```
      THE DEMO REHEARSAL:

      1. Run full demo 3 times
      2. On actual presentation machine
      3. In actual demo environment
      4. With actual network conditions
      5. Time it

      If it fails in rehearsal, it WILL fail live.
      ```

      ### Layered Backups

      | Layer | What | When to use |
      |-------|------|-------------|
      | 1 | Second try | Quick network glitch |
      | 2 | Recorded video | Persistent issue |
      | 3 | Screenshots | Video won't play |
      | 4 | Verbal walkthrough | All tech fails |

      ### In-the-Moment Recovery

      ```
      WHEN IT FAILS:

      1. Don't panic (they're watching your reaction)
      2. Acknowledge briefly: "Let me try something"
      3. Pivot within 10 seconds
      4. "Let me show you a recording of this working"
      5. Continue with confidence
      ```

      ### The Pivot Lines

      | Situation | Say |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Loading forever | "While this is being slow, let me explain what you'd see..." |
      | Error message | "Interesting! Here's a backup view..." |
      | Complete crash | "Technology, right? Let me show you this video instead." |
      | Nothing works | "Let me walk you through what this does..." |
    symptoms:
      - Error messages on screen
      - Audience watching you struggle
      - Losing credibility
      - Demo derailed
    detection_pattern: "it's not working|give me a second|that's weird"

  - id: wrong-audience
    summary: Demo pitched at wrong level for audience
    severity: medium
    situation: Executives glazed over, or engineers bored
    why: |
      One-size-fits-all demo.
      Didn't research audience.
      Presented what's interesting to you.
    solution: |
      ## Audience Calibration

      ### Know Your Audience

      | Question | Why |
      |----------|-----|
      | Who's in the room? | Titles, roles |
      | What do they care about? | Goals, pressures |
      | What's their context? | What they know already |
      | What will they do after? | Decision they'll make |

      ### Audience Profiles

      | Type | Focus On | Avoid |
      |------|----------|-------|
      | CEO | Bottom line, strategic impact | Technical details |
      | VP Product | User value, market fit | Implementation |
      | Engineering Lead | Architecture, quality | Business metrics |
      | Sales | Can they sell it | Complexity |

      ### Real-Time Calibration

      ```
      READ THE ROOM:

      Glazed eyes → Go higher level
      Nodding, leaning in → You're landing
      Checking phones → Speed up, get to payoff
      Questions → Engage, adjust
      ```

      ### The Escape Hatch

      | If... | Then... |
      |-------|---------|
      | Too technical | "The bottom line is..." |
      | Too high-level | "Under the hood, this means..." |
      | Losing them | "The key takeaway is..." |
      | Confused looks | "Let me show you what I mean..." |
    symptoms:
      - Blank stares
      - Wrong questions
      - "Can you dumb it down"
      - "Can you go deeper"
    detection_pattern: "don't understand|too technical|more detail|so what"

  - id: invisible-progress
    summary: Good work doesn't get recognized
    severity: medium
    situation: Doing great work but nobody knows
    why: |
      Work isn't demoable.
      No visibility strategy.
      "Work speaks for itself" myth.
    solution: |
      ## Making Work Visible

      ### The Visibility Problem

      ```
      REALITY:
      - 90% of engineering is invisible
      - Stakeholders see features, not foundations
      - Undemoable ≠ unimportant

      BUT:
      - Invisible work gets no credit
      - No credit = no support
      - No support = no resources
      ```

      ### Visibility Strategies

      | Work Type | Make Visible |
      |-----------|--------------|
      | Performance | Graphs before/after |
      | Reliability | Uptime dashboard |
      | Security | Risk reduction metrics |
      | Tech debt | Velocity improvement |
      | Refactoring | Time-to-feature change |

      ### The Proxy Demo

      ```
      CAN'T SHOW THE THING?
      Show the IMPACT:

      "We rebuilt the deploy pipeline"
      DEMO: "Watch: I push code and it's live in 2 minutes"
             "Before: This took 30 minutes"

      "We improved database performance"
      DEMO: Graph showing response time drop
            "Users now wait 100ms, not 3 seconds"
      ```

      ### Regular Visibility

      | Cadence | What |
      |---------|------|
      | Weekly | Slack update with metrics |
      | Sprint | Demo anything visual |
      | Monthly | Impact report |
      | Quarterly | Before/after presentation |
    symptoms:
      - "What has your team been doing?"
      - Skepticism about progress
      - Undervalued work
      - Resource cuts
    detection_pattern: "what are you working on|no progress|nothing to show"

  - id: demo-scope-creep
    summary: Demo grows to show everything
    severity: medium
    situation: 5-minute demo becomes 30-minute tour
    why: |
      Want to show all the work.
      Fear of leaving things out.
      No editing discipline.
    solution: |
      ## Demo Scope Control

      ### The Editing Rule

      ```
      RULE:
      Cut your demo in half.
      Then cut it in half again.

      What's left is your demo.
      ```

      ### Time Limits

      | Audience | Max Time |
      |----------|----------|
      | Executives | 5 minutes |
      | Stakeholders | 10 minutes |
      | Team | 15 minutes |
      | Deep dive | 30 minutes (rare) |

      ### Feature Prioritization

      | Show | Mention | Skip |
      |------|---------|------|
      | New + impactful | New + minor | Maintenance |
      | Visual + exciting | Behind-scenes | Edge cases |
      | Requested | Supporting | Technical debt |

      ### The "One More Thing" Trap

      ```
      RESIST:
      "And also we did..."
      "Oh and I should mention..."
      "Let me quickly show..."

      INSTEAD:
      End on a high note.
      Leave them wanting more.
      "I'll share more details in follow-up"
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Demo running long
      - Audience checking time
      - Rushed ending
      - No time for Q&A
    detection_pattern: "one more thing|also|running out of time|quickly show"
