    summary: Brands trying to meme and failing spectacularly
    severity: high
    situation: Company wants to be "relatable" with memes
    why: |
      Authenticity can't be faked.
      Internet detects marketing instantly.
      Cringe spreads faster than success.
    solution: |
      ## Corporate Meme Strategy

      ### The Fundamental Problem

      ```
      Why brands fail at memes:

      1. Approval processes kill timing
      2. Legal review strips edge
      3. Committees water down humor
      4. Authenticity requires risk
      5. Internet hates being marketed to
      ```

      ### What Actually Works

      | Approach | Example |
      |----------|---------|
      | Self-deprecation | Acknowledge you're a brand |
      | Absurdist commitment | Lean into weird fully |
      | Speed over polish | Real-time response team |
      | Let people cook | Empower individual voice |
      | Embrace roasts | Laugh at yourself |

      ### Brand Meme Tiers

      | Tier | Permission Level |
      |------|------------------|
      | S | Wendy's, Duolingo - anything goes |
      | A | Can be weird with guardrails |
      | B | Can reference trends safely |
      | C | Stick to owned content |
      | F | Just don't |

      ### Decision Framework

      ```
      Before posting corporate meme:

      □ Would a human actually share this?
      □ Are we laughing WITH the internet?
      □ Does this feel genuine?
      □ Can we handle being roasted?
      □ Is our response time fast enough?

      If any "no" → don't post.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "How do you do fellow kids" energy
      - Heavy-handed brand insertion
      - Approval took days

  - id: meme-timing-miss
    summary: Perfect meme, terrible timing
    severity: medium
    situation: Great content posted too late or at wrong moment
    why: |
      Memes have shelf life measured in hours.
      Context changes meaning.
      Being late = being cringe.
    solution: |
      ## Timing Mastery

      ### Speed Tiers

      | Content Type | Max Delay |
      |--------------|-----------|
      | Breaking news meme | 2-4 hours |
      | Trending topic | 24 hours |
      | Format adaptation | 48 hours |
      | Original concept | No rush |

      ### Timing Checklist

      ```
      Before posting:

      1. Is this still trending?
      2. Has the narrative shifted?
      3. Did something more important happen?
      4. Is the format still fresh?
      5. Am I adding or echoing?
      ```

      ### Recovery Options

      | Situation | Recovery |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Topic moved on | Hold for next relevant moment |
      | Format died | Adapt to current format |
      | Context changed | Rework or kill |
      | Moment passed | Save for ironic revival later |

      ### Building Speed

      ```
      Reduce time-to-post:

      - Pre-approved flexibility
      - Empowered individuals
      - Template library ready
      - Fast creation tools
      - Skip committee for low-risk
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "This would've been funny last week"
      - No engagement despite quality
      - Comments pointing out lateness
    detection_pattern: "this took too long|late to this|old meme"

  - id: audience-mismatch
    summary: Right meme, wrong audience
    severity: medium
    situation: Meme doesn't resonate with target community
    why: |
      Different communities = different references.
      What's funny in one is cringe in another.
      Internet is not monolithic.
    solution: |
      ## Audience Calibration

      ### Community Mapping

      | Community | Humor Style | References |
      |-----------|-------------|------------|
      | Tech Twitter | Self-deprecating, niche | Coding, startups |
      | FinTwit | Dark, money-focused | Trading, markets |
      | Gaming | Fast, reference-heavy | Specific games |
      | Academic | Absurdist, self-aware | Field-specific |
      | Gen Z | Chaotic, layers deep | Current trends |

      ### Research Before Posting

      ```
      For any community:

      1. Lurk first (seriously)
      2. Note what gets engagement
      3. Identify shared references
      4. Understand taboos
      5. Test with small posts
      ```

      ### Cross-Community Translation

      | Original | Tech | Marketing | Finance |
      |----------|------|-----------|---------|
      | Drake format | Works | Works | Works |
      | Coding joke | Native | Confused | Lost |
      | Sales joke | Gets it | Native | Gets it |

      ### When in Doubt

      ```
      Default to:
      - Universal human experiences
      - Widely known references
      - Simpler formats
      - Less niche humor

      Save deep cuts for communities you know.
