# Easter Egg Design Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: maintenance-burden
    summary: Easter eggs that become technical debt
    severity: medium
    situation: Hidden features that break or need constant updates
    why: |
      Forgotten in refactors.
      Dependencies change.
      No one owns them.

      ## Sustainable Easter Eggs

      ### Design for Longevity

      ```
      Easter egg architecture:

      1. ISOLATION
         - Separate from core code
         - Own module/component
         - Clear boundaries

      2. SIMPLICITY
         - Minimal dependencies
         - Self-contained logic
         - Simple triggers

      3. DOCUMENTATION
         - Document existence
         - Document triggers
         - Document owners
      ```

      ### Maintenance Checklist

      | Check | Frequency |
      |-------|-----------|
      | Still working? | Every release |
      | References current? | Quarterly |
      | Owner assigned? | Yearly |
      | Worth keeping? | Yearly |

      ### Graceful Degradation

      ```
      If easter egg breaks:

      Option A: Fix it (if worth it)
      Option B: Remove cleanly (if not)
      Option C: Degrade gracefully (show nothing)

      Never: Leave broken
      ```

      ### Technical Patterns

      | Pattern | Benefit |
      |---------|---------|
      | Feature flag | Easy to disable |
      | Lazy loading | No core impact |
      | Time limit | Natural sunset |
      | Fallback | Breaks silently |
    symptoms:
      - Broken easter eggs in production
      - No one knows how it works
      - Blocks refactoring
    detection_pattern: "broken easter egg|who owns this|can we remove"

  - id: accessibility-failure
    summary: Easter eggs that exclude users
    severity: high
    situation: Discovery requires abilities some users don't have
    why: |
      Designed for one input method.
      Visual-only reveals.
      Timing requirements.
    solution: |
      ## Accessible Easter Eggs

      ### Inclusive Discovery

      | Barrier | Solution |
      |---------|----------|
      | Mouse-only trigger | Add keyboard equivalent |
      | Visual-only reward | Add audio/text |
      | Timing-dependent | Allow flexible timing |
      | Color-dependent | Use patterns/text too |

      ### Multiple Paths

      ```
      Good easter egg:

      Trigger options:
      - Click logo 5 times OR
      - Press Ctrl+Alt+E OR
      - Type "surprise" anywhere

      Multiple ways in = more inclusive.
      ```

      ### Reward Accessibility

      | Reward Type | Accessibility |
      |-------------|---------------|
      | Visual only | Add alt text, aria |
      | Audio only | Add captions, visual |
      | Motion | Provide static option |
      | Game | Ensure keyboard playable |

      ### Testing Checklist

      ```
      Before shipping:

      □ Works with keyboard only?
      □ Works with screen reader?
      □ No timing requirements?
      □ Color-blind friendly?
      □ Doesn't trigger seizures?
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "I couldn't access it"
      - Relies on specific abilities
      - Excludes user segments
    detection_pattern: "can't trigger|accessibility|keyboard"

  - id: cultural-misfire
    summary: References that don't translate across cultures
    severity: medium
    situation: Easter egg relies on culture-specific knowledge
    why: |
      Pop culture isn't universal.
      References age quickly.
      Humor doesn't translate.
    solution: |
      ## Universal Delight

      ### Culture-Safe Categories

      | Safe | Risky |
      |------|-------|
      | Universal humor | Country-specific |
      | Visual gags | Language puns |
      | Math/logic puzzles | Cultural references |
      | Product self-reference | Pop culture |
      | Animal cuteness | Regional memes |

      ### Reference Lifespan

      | Reference Type | Lifespan |
      |----------------|----------|
      | Classic (Star Wars) | Decades |
      | Current trend | Months |
      | Meme | Weeks to months |
      | News | Days |

      ### Global Testing

      ```
      Before shipping:

      1. Test with diverse users
      2. Check if reference translates
      3. Verify no offensive meanings
      4. Consider all markets

      When in doubt, go universal.
      ```

      ### Localization Strategy

      | Approach | Pros | Cons |
      |----------|------|------|
      | Universal | Works everywhere | Less targeted |
      | Localized | More relevant | More work |
      | Market-specific | Deep resonance | Limited reach |
    symptoms:
      - "I don't get it"
      - Works in US only
      - Offensive in some cultures
    detection_pattern: "don't understand|what does this mean|cultural"

  - id: discovery-exploitation
    summary: Users gaming discovery for rewards
    severity: low
    situation: Easter eggs with valuable rewards get exploited
    why: |
      Rewards too valuable.
      Easy to share method.
      Undermines specialness.
    solution: |
      ## Reward Calibration

      ### Value Tiers

      | Reward Value | Discovery Difficulty |
      |--------------|---------------------|
      | High (features) | Very hidden |
      | Medium (cosmetic) | Moderate |
      | Low (fun only) | Easy to find |

      ### Exploitation Prevention

      ```
      For valuable rewards:

      1. Rate limit (once per user)
      2. Require account
      3. Time-gate availability
      4. Make discovery personal

      For fun rewards:
      Let them be found and shared!
      ```

      ### The Right Balance

      | If everyone knows | It's not special |
      | If no one knows | It's not found |
      | If some know | Perfect tension |

      ### Embrace Sharing

      ```
      Often, exploitation isn't bad:

      - Spreads word of mouth
      - Increases engagement
      - Shows product personality
      - Creates community moments

      Only protect if reward is truly valuable.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Tutorials showing easter egg
      - Everyone knows immediately
      - Feels less special
    detection_pattern: "everyone knows|spoiled|too easy to find"
