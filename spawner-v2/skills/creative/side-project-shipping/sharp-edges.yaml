# Side Project Shipping Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: perfectionism-paralysis
    summary: Endless polishing instead of shipping
    severity: high
    situation: Project is 80% done but never launches
    why: |
      Perfectionism is fear in disguise.
      "Not ready" = "I'm scared to be judged."
      Each polish cycle delays feedback.
    solution: |
      ## Breaking Perfectionism Paralysis

      ### The Uncomfortable Truth

      ```
      Your side project will NEVER feel ready.

      "Ready" is a moving target.
      Every time you approach it, it moves.

      The only way to hit the target is to
      declare an arbitrary deadline and SHIP.
      ```

      ### The 80% Rule

      | Completion | Action |
      |------------|--------|
      | < 50% | Keep building core |
      | 50-80% | Start cutting features |
      | 80% | STOP. Ship now. |
      | 80-99% | You're procrastinating |
      | 100% | Doesn't exist |

      ### Deadline Commitment

      ```
      Pick a date. Tell people.

      "I'm launching [PROJECT] on [DATE]."

      Post it publicly.
      Tell your friends.
      Schedule the Product Hunt.

      Now you HAVE to ship something.
      ```

      ### Permission Slip

      ```
      You have permission to ship:

      □ Buggy code
      □ Ugly UI
      □ Missing features
      □ Incomplete docs
      □ Hardcoded values
      □ No tests

      All of these beat "not shipped."
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Just one more thing"
      - "Let me polish this first"
      - "Almost ready"
      - "Next weekend for sure"
    detection_pattern: "almost done|nearly ready|just need to"

  - id: scope-explosion
    summary: Side project becomes main project
    severity: high
    situation: Simple idea balloons into complex system
    why: |
      Ideas breed ideas.
      Each feature suggests more features.
      No external pressure to stop.
    solution: |
      ## Scope Explosion Prevention

      ### The Original Vision Test

      ```
      Write down your original idea.
      Put it somewhere visible.

      Every feature decision:
      "Does this serve the ORIGINAL idea?"

      NO → Cut it
      MAYBE → Cut it
      YES → Maybe keep it
      ```

      ### The Complexity Budget

      | Budget | Spend Wisely |
      |--------|--------------|
      | 1 hard thing | Your core value |
      | 2-3 medium things | Supporting features |
      | Everything else | Cut or simplify |

      ### Feature Request Response

      ```
      Your brain: "We should add X!"

      Your response:
      1. Write it in V2_FEATURES.md
      2. Close the file
      3. Continue shipping V1

      Do not engage with the idea.
      Do not "just sketch it out."
      Do not "see how hard it would be."
      ```

      ### The "Would I Start Over?" Test

      | If current scope requires... | Decision |
      |-----------------------------|----------|
      | Complete rewrite | You've lost the plot |
      | Major architecture change | Scope has exploded |
      | "Just" a few more weeks | Time to cut |
    symptoms:
      - "While I'm at it..."
      - "This would be easy to add"
      - "Users will expect..."
      - Project now needs database/auth/etc
    detection_pattern: "while we're at it|easy to add|might as well"

  - id: technology-tourism
    summary: Using side project to learn new tech
    severity: medium
    situation: Learning curve kills shipping momentum
    why: |
      New tech is exciting.
      Learning feels productive.
      But you're not shipping.
    solution: |
      ## Boring Tech Ships Faster

      ### The Technology Decision

      ```
      SHIPPING GOAL:
      Use the most boring tech you know.
      The thing you could build in your sleep.

      LEARNING GOAL:
      Accept you probably won't ship.
      That's okay if you're honest about it.

      PICK ONE. Don't pretend you can do both.
      ```

      ### The Familiarity Scale

      | Tech Familiarity | Ship Probability |
      |------------------|------------------|
      | Could do blindfolded | 80% |
      | Done it a few times | 50% |
      | Tried it once | 20% |
      | Never used it | 5% |
      | "Looks cool" | 1% |

      ### When To Use New Tech

      | Condition | Use New Tech? |
      |-----------|---------------|
      | Goal is learning | Yes |
      | Goal is shipping | No |
      | "I'll learn while building" | Trap! |

      ### Recovery From Tech Trap

      ```
      If you're stuck on new tech:

      OPTION A: Switch to boring tech (restart)
      OPTION B: Drastically cut scope
      OPTION C: Accept learning project (no ship pressure)

      Don't stay stuck in the middle.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Hours lost in documentation
      - "Once I understand X..."
      - Tutorial purgatory
      - Framework switching
    detection_pattern: "let me learn|new framework|try this tech"

  - id: solo-death-spiral
    summary: Working alone leads to abandonment
    severity: medium
    situation: No external accountability, project dies
    why: |
      No one waiting on you.
      Easy to deprioritize.
      No one notices if you stop.
    solution: |
      ## Building in Public

      ### Accountability Structures

      | Structure | How |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Public commits | GitHub activity visible |
      | Build in public | Tweet/post progress |
      | Accountability buddy | Weekly check-ins |
      | Pre-announce launch | Can't back out |

      ### The "Someone's Watching" Effect

      ```
      When you tell people:
      - You feel obligated
      - You get encouragement
      - You can't quietly abandon
      - Sunk cost (social) kicks in
      ```

      ### Minimum Viable Accountability

      | Low Effort | High Impact |
      |------------|-------------|
      | Tell one friend | They'll ask about it |
      | One public post | Can't pretend it doesn't exist |
      | Join a community | Others doing the same |

      ### Weekly Check-In Template

      ```
      Every Sunday, post:

      "This week on [PROJECT]:
      - Did: [X]
      - Learned: [Y]
      - Next: [Z]

      Shipping on: [DATE]"

      Keep yourself honest.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Weeks without commits
      - "I'll get back to it"
      - No one knows about the project
      - Easy to abandon
    detection_pattern: "working on it|when I have time|eventually"
