      ## Trend Lifecycle

      ### 1. Lifecycle Stages

      ```
           ┌─────┐
          /       \  PEAK
         /         \
        /    ↑      \    ↓
       /  RISING     \  FALLING
      /               \
     └─────────────────────┘
      EMERGING        DEAD/IRONIC

      Stage affects strategy.
      ```

      ### 2. Stage Indicators

      | Stage | Signs |
      |-------|-------|
      | Emerging | Small accounts, niche only |
      | Rising | Spreading across communities |
      | Peak | Everyone doing it |
      | Falling | "Old news" feeling |
      | Dead | Cringe to use |
      | Ironic revival | Meta-usage by in-crowd |

      ### 3. Stage Strategy

      | Stage | Strategy |
      |-------|----------|
      | Emerging | High risk, high reward |
      | Rising | Best time - fresh but validated |
      | Peak | Last chance - need unique angle |
      | Falling | Generally avoid |
      | Dead | Definitely avoid |
      | Ironic | Only if very on-brand |

      ### 4. Speed Requirements

      ```
      Time windows:

      BREAKING NEWS: Hours
      VIRAL MOMENT: 24-48 hours
      PLATFORM TREND: 3-5 days
      FORMAT TREND: 1-2 weeks

      ## Trend Fit Analysis

      ### 1. Fit Criteria

      | Criterion | Question |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Brand fit | Does this match who we are? |
      | Audience fit | Will our people care? |
      | Capability fit | Can we execute well? |
      | Timing fit | Can we move fast enough? |
      | Risk fit | Can we handle if it goes wrong? |

      ### 2. Quick Assessment

      ```
      Score 1-5 on each:

      □ Brand alignment
      □ Audience interest
      □ Execution ability
      □ Speed capability
      □ Risk tolerance

      Total 20+: Go for it
      Total 15-19: Consider carefully
      Total <15: Sit this one out
      ```

      ### 3. Red Flags

      | Red Flag | Why |
      |----------|-----|
      | Requires explaining | Too niche for your audience |
      | Feels forced | Authenticity issue |
      | Controversial | Risk vs reward imbalance |
      | Peaked already | Too late |
      | Off-brand | Confuses positioning |

      ### 4. Permission Check

      ```
      Do you have permission to participate?

      EARNED:
      - Already known for this vibe
      - Audience expects it
      - Track record in space

      UNEARNED:
      - First time in this space
      - Audience will be surprised
      - "How do you do fellow kids" risk
      ```

      ## Remix Strategy

      ### 1. Remix Principle

      ```
      Never copy. Always remix.

      COPY:
      - Same format
      - Same joke
      - Nothing added

      REMIX:
      - Same format
      - Your unique spin
      - Adds to conversation
      ```

      ### 2. Remix Techniques

      | Technique | How |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Industry twist | Apply to your field |
      | Product integration | Connect to what you do |
      | Subversion | Opposite of expected |
      | Escalation | Take further |
      | Mashup | Combine with another trend |

      ### 3. Remix Formula

      ```
      [TRENDING FORMAT] + [YOUR UNIQUE ELEMENT] = REMIX

      Examples:
      - Trending dance + your product = branded content
      - Viral format + industry insight = relevant commentary
      - Popular meme + self-deprecation = authentic engagement
      ```

      ### 4. Quality Check

      | Checkpoint | Pass? |
      |------------|-------|
      | Is this just copying? | |
      | Does it add something? | |
      | Would this stand alone? | |
      | Is the spin obvious? | |
      | Is it on-brand? | |

      ## Moment Jacking

      ### 1. Moment Types

      | Type | Speed Required | Risk |
      |------|----------------|------|
      | Breaking news | Hours | High |
      | Viral moment | Hours-Day | Medium |
      | Pop culture event | Day | Low-Medium |
      | Seasonal | Planned | Low |
      | Industry news | Day | Low |

      ### 2. The Speed-Quality Trade-off

      ```
      Breaking moments:
      First + Good > Late + Perfect

      BUT:

      First + Bad < Not at all
      Late + Great > First + Mediocre

      Speed matters, but not more than quality.
      ```

      ### 3. Safe Moment Categories

      | Safe | Risky |
      |------|-------|
      | Sports (usually) | Politics |
      | Entertainment | Tragedy |
      | Pop culture | Religion |
      | Industry events | Controversy |
      | Holidays | Breaking news |

      ### 4. Execution Checklist

      ```
      Before posting:

      □ Is moment still active?
      □ Has context changed?
      □ Is our take unique?
      □ Could this age badly?
      □ Is this on-brand?
      □ Is the connection natural?
      ```
