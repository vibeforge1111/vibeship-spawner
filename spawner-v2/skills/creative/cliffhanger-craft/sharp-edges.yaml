# Cliffhanger Craft Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: cliffhanger-fatigue
    summary: Audience tired of constant cliffhangers
    severity: medium
    situation: Every piece ends with tension
    why: |
      Never resolved.
      Always demands attention.
      Exhausting to follow.
    solution: |
      ## Managing Cliffhanger Fatigue

      ### Recognition Signals

      | Signal | Meaning |
      |--------|---------|
      | Lower return rates | Diminishing interest |
      | "Get to the point" comments | Frustration |
      | Skipping to end | Impatience |
      | Unfollows | Exhaustion |

      ### Variation Strategy

      ```
      Not every ending needs cliffhanger:

      FULL RESOLUTION (40%)
      - Complete satisfaction
      - Clear value delivered
      - Earns next cliffhanger

      SOFT TEASE (40%)
      - Gentle preview
      - No tension, just interest
      - Easy to skip

      HARD CLIFFHANGER (20%)
      - Full tension
      - Can't miss next
      - Use sparingly
      ```

      ### Recovery Pattern

      | Issue | Response |
      |-------|----------|
      | Fatigue detected | Deliver resolution |
      | Trust eroded | Over-deliver on next |
      | Engagement dropping | Ease up on cliffs |

      ### Sustainable Pacing

      ```
      Monthly rhythm:

      Week 1: Resolution + value
      Week 2: Soft tease
      Week 3: Resolution + value
      Week 4: Major cliffhanger

      Earns the big moments.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Declining return rates
      - "Just tell me" comments
      - Audience frustration
    detection_pattern: "get to point|tired of waiting|just tell us"

  - id: payoff-failure
    summary: Cliffhanger resolution disappoints
    severity: high
    situation: Buildup exceeds delivery
    why: |
      Promised too much.
      Resolution not planned.
      Expectations too high.
    solution: |
      ## Payoff Management

      ### Promise-Delivery Match

      ```
      Cliffhanger promises X.
      Resolution must be ≥X.

      If you can't deliver X:
      - Don't promise X
      - Lower the cliff
      - Find X before cliffhanger
      ```

      ### Pre-Planning Rule

      | Before Cliffhanger | Have Ready |
      |--------------------|------------|
      | "To be continued" | The continuation |
      | "Part 2 reveals..." | Part 2 content |
      | "Next week..." | Next week content |

      ### Exceeding Expectations

      ```
      Great payoffs:

      1. Deliver what was promised
      2. Add unexpected bonus
      3. Open new exciting thread
      4. Make wait feel worth it
      ```

      ### If You Can't Deliver

      | Situation | Response |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Promised too much | Acknowledge, over-deliver elsewhere |
      | Can't finish | Honest explanation |
      | Changed direction | Bridge content |
    symptoms:
      - Disappointment after reveal
      - "That's it?" reactions
      - Trust erosion
    detection_pattern: "disappointed|not worth it|waited for this"

  - id: gap-too-long
    summary: Too much time between cliffhanger and resolution
    severity: medium
    situation: Audience forgets or loses interest
    why: |
      Gap too long.
      No reminders.
      Competed attention.
    solution: |
      ## Gap Optimization

      ### Maximum Gaps

      | Content Type | Max Gap |
      |--------------|---------|
      | Thread series | 24 hours |
      | Newsletter | 1 week |
      | Video | 1 week |
      | Major series | 2 weeks |

      ### Memory Management

      ```
      For longer gaps:

      1. REMINDER
         - Email notification
         - Social preview
         - "Previously on..."

      2. RECAP
         - Quick summary
         - Key points
         - Re-hook

      3. RE-TENSION
         - Rebuild before resolving
         - Remind of stakes
         - Renew investment
      ```

      ### If Gap Is Unavoidable

      | Strategy | Implementation |
      |----------|----------------|
      | Teaser content | Fill gap with related content |
      | Community discussion | Keep conversation alive |
      | Countdown | Build anticipation |
      | Behind-the-scenes | Maintain engagement |
    symptoms:
      - "What was this about again?"
      - Low return rates
      - Need heavy recap
    detection_pattern: "forgot|reminder|what happened"

  - id: mobile-cut-off
    summary: Cliffhanger cut off by platform truncation
    severity: medium
    situation: Key tension hidden below fold or truncated
    why: |
      Didn't check preview.
      Platform limits not known.
      Desktop-designed content.
    solution: |
      ## Platform Optimization

      ### Platform Limits

      | Platform | Visible Before Expand |
      |----------|----------------------|
      | Twitter | 280 chars, 2 lines preview |
      | LinkedIn | ~150 chars, 2-3 lines |
      | Email | Subject + preview text |
      | Newsletter | Above fold |

      ### Cliffhanger Placement

      ```
      For expandable content:

      VISIBLE ZONE (above fold)
      ├── Hook
      ├── Value
      └── Tension builder

      HIDDEN ZONE (below fold)
      ├── Full content
      └── Cliffhanger

      Make visible zone compelling enough
      to earn the expand.
      ```

      ### Testing

      | Check | Before |
      |-------|--------|
      | Mobile preview | Every post |
      | Email preview | Every send |
      | Truncation | Every platform |

      ### Design for Truncation

      ```
      If cliffhanger might be cut:

      1. Full cliff in visible zone
      2. Or, cliff earns the expand
      3. Test on actual platforms
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Low engagement on cliffhanger posts
      - Full content not seen
      - Tension lost to truncation
    detection_pattern: "didn't see|cut off|mobile"
