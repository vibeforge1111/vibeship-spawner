# Collaboration - Web3 Gaming
# How this skill works with other skills

version: 1.0.0
skill_id: web3-gaming

prerequisites:
  required:
    - skill: smart-contract-engineer
      reason: "Game contracts require solid Solidity fundamentals"
    - skill: nft-engineer
      reason: "Most Web3 games have NFT components"

  recommended:
    - skill: token-launch
      reason: "Game tokens need proper launch strategy"
    - skill: smart-contract-auditor
      reason: "Economic exploits can drain game treasuries"

handoff_data:
  provides:
    - game_contract_addresses
    - token_addresses
    - nft_collection_addresses
    - game_economy_model
    - reward_signing_spec

  expects:
    - token_vesting_setup (from token-launch)
    - nft_standards (from nft-engineer)
    - audit_report (from smart-contract-auditor)
    - wallet_sdk (from wallet-integration)

integration_notes: |
  Web3 Gaming is a complex skill that often requires collaboration
  with multiple other skills:

  - Token economics → token-launch
  - NFT items → nft-engineer
  - Security → smart-contract-auditor
  - Governance → dao-governance
  - Wallets → wallet-integration, account-abstraction
  - Analytics → onchain-analytics
  - Cross-chain → cross-chain

  Start with economic model validation before implementation.
  Audit before launch is non-negotiable for games with real
  monetary value at stake.
