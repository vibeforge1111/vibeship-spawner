cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Game Design
    insight: NFTs work best as progression markers, not monetization
    application: Design NFTs that enhance gameplay, not paywall it

  - domain: Collectibles Market
    insight: Scarcity alone doesn't create value - utility and community do
    application: Build utility before emphasizing rarity

  - domain: Digital Art
    insight: Provenance is the killer feature, not ownership
    application: Emphasize creation story and artist relationship

  - domain: Fashion Industry
    insight: Limited drops create FOMO but damage long-term brand
    application: Balance exclusivity with accessibility

  - domain: Ticketing
    insight: NFTs excel at proof-of-attendance and access control
    application: POAPs and token-gated experiences
