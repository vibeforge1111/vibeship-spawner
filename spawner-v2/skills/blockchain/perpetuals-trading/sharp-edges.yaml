  - id: oracle-deviation-exploit
    summary: Small oracle deviations enable profitable exploits
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Your perp uses Chainlink for pricing. Chainlink updates on
      0.5% deviation. An attacker exploits the 0.5% gap between
      Chainlink and actual market price repeatedly.
    why: |
      Chainlink and similar oracles update on threshold deviations
      to save gas. This creates small windows where the oracle
      price doesn't match the market, enabling MEV extraction.
    solution: |
      # MULTI-ORACLE WITH DEVIATION CHECKS

      contract PerpOracle {
          IChainlinkAggregator public primaryOracle;
          IChainlinkAggregator public secondaryOracle;
          uint256 public constant MAX_DEVIATION = 0.005e18; // 0.5%

          function getPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
              uint256 primary = _getChainlinkPrice(primaryOracle);
              uint256 secondary = _getChainlinkPrice(secondaryOracle);

              // Check deviation between oracles
              uint256 deviation = _calculateDeviation(primary, secondary);
              require(deviation <= MAX_DEVIATION, "Price deviation too high");

              // Use median or average
              return (primary + secondary) / 2;
          }

          // Additional protections
          function validatePriceMovement(
              uint256 oldPrice,
              uint256 newPrice,
              uint256 maxMovementBps
          ) internal pure {
              uint256 movement = _calculateDeviation(oldPrice, newPrice);
              require(movement <= maxMovementBps, "Price moved too fast");
          }
      }

      GMX V2 Approach:
      - Primary: Chainlink price feeds
      - Secondary: Signed prices from off-chain oracles
      - Real-time signed prices for execution
      - Chainlink as fallback/validation
    symptoms:
      - Consistent small profits by sophisticated traders
      - Price differences vs CEX at trade time
      - MEV bots extracting value
    detection_pattern: 'getLatestPrice(?!.*deviation|.*secondary)'

  - id: funding-manipulation
    summary: Open interest manipulation to farm funding
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Large trader opens massive long position, pushing funding
      rate negative. They hold offsetting short on another platform,
      collecting funding as the "minority side."
    why: |
      Funding rates are designed to balance longs and shorts.
      But if one party can dominate open interest, they control
      the funding rate and can farm it from the other side.
    solution: |
      # CAP POSITION SIZE AND RATE

      contract FundingProtection {
          uint256 public constant MAX_POSITION_SHARE = 0.1e18; // 10% of OI

          function openPosition(int256 size) external {
              int256 totalOI = longOI + shortOI;
              int256 newPositionShare = (abs(size) * 1e18) / totalOI;

              require(
                  newPositionShare <= MAX_POSITION_SHARE,
                  "Position too large"
              );

              // Also cap funding rate
              require(
                  abs(currentFundingRate) <= MAX_FUNDING_RATE,
                  "Funding rate capped"
              );
          }

          // Time-weighted funding to prevent gaming
          function calculateFunding() public view returns (int256) {
              // Use TWAP of OI imbalance, not instant
              return fundingRateTWAP;
          }
      }

      Additional Measures:
      - Delay funding rate changes
      - Use time-weighted average OI
      - Cap maximum funding rate
      - Monitor for correlated positions across platforms
    symptoms:
      - Extreme funding rates (>0.5% per 8h)
      - Single address dominating one side
      - Coordinated positions across venues

  - id: liquidation-cascade
    summary: Mass liquidations cause cascading price impact
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Price drops 10%. Leveraged longs get liquidated. Liquidations
      push price down further. More liquidations trigger. Cascade
      continues until pool is drained.
    why: |
      Liquidations sell into the market. In thin liquidity or AMM
      pools, this creates price impact. Price impact triggers more
      liquidations. This feedback loop is the "cascade."
    solution: |
      # GRADUAL LIQUIDATION AND BACKSTOPS

      contract GradualLiquidation {
          uint256 public constant PARTIAL_LIQ_RATIO = 0.25e18; // 25%
          uint256 public constant CIRCUIT_BREAKER = 0.05e18;   // 5% drop
          uint256 public priceAtIntervalStart;
          bool public circuitBreakerActive;

          function liquidate(address trader) external {
              require(!circuitBreakerActive, "Market halted");

              Position storage pos = positions[trader];

              // Partial liquidation - only close 25%
              uint256 closeSize = (pos.size * PARTIAL_LIQ_RATIO) / 1e18;

              // Check price impact
              uint256 impact = calculatePriceImpact(closeSize);
              require(impact <= MAX_IMPACT, "Impact too high");

              // Close partial position
              _closePosition(trader, closeSize);

              // If still underwater, schedule next partial
              if (isLiquidatable(trader)) {
                  scheduledLiquidations[trader] = block.timestamp + 1 minutes;
              }
          }

          // Circuit breaker for extreme moves
          function checkCircuitBreaker() internal {
              if (block.timestamp >= intervalEnd) {
                  priceAtIntervalStart = currentPrice;
                  intervalEnd = block.timestamp + 1 hours;
              }

              uint256 movement = _deviation(currentPrice, priceAtIntervalStart);
              if (movement >= CIRCUIT_BREAKER) {
                  circuitBreakerActive = true;
                  emit CircuitBreaker(currentPrice, movement);
              }
          }
      }

      Additional Protections:
      - ADL (Auto-Deleveraging) before insurance fund
      - Reduce max leverage during high volatility
      - Dynamic maintenance margin
      - Cross-margin to share collateral
    symptoms:
      - Price drops much further than spot
      - Cascade of liquidation events
      - Insurance fund depleted

  - id: bad-debt-socialization
    summary: Bad debt distributed to winning traders
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Large position gets liquidated underwater. Insurance fund
      is empty. Protocol socializes losses by reducing winning
      traders' profits proportionally.
    why: |
      When a position is liquidated with negative equity (bad debt),
      someone must absorb the loss. If insurance fund is depleted,
      protocols often socialize losses to remain solvent.
    solution: |
      # TIERED LOSS ABSORPTION

      Loss Absorption Waterfall:
      1. Trader's remaining collateral
      2. Liquidation penalty (paid to liquidator)
      3. Insurance fund
      4. ADL (Auto-Deleveraging) most profitable positions
      5. Socialization (last resort)

      contract InsuranceFund {
          uint256 public fundBalance;
          uint256 public constant MIN_FUND_RATIO = 0.02e18; // 2% of OI

          function absorbBadDebt(uint256 debt) external onlyLiquidationEngine {
              if (fundBalance >= debt) {
                  fundBalance -= debt;
                  return;
              }

              // Partial coverage
              uint256 covered = fundBalance;
              fundBalance = 0;
              uint256 uncovered = debt - covered;

              // ADL before socialization
              _autoDeleverage(uncovered);
          }

          function _autoDeleverage(uint256 amount) internal {
              // Find most profitable positions on opposite side
              // Force-close them at current price
              // They take the loss instead of everyone
          }
      }

      ADL Ranking:
      - Profit ratio = PnL / Position Size
      - Higher profit ratio = first to be ADL'd
      - Fairer than random socialization
    symptoms:
      - Winning trades receive less than expected
      - Unexpected position closures
      - Insurance fund at zero

  - id: stale-position-interest
    summary: Abandoned positions accumulate unbounded fees
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Trader opens small position and forgets about it. Borrow fees
      accumulate for months. When finally liquidated, the position
      owes more than the entire protocol's insurance fund.
    why: |
      Borrow fees compound over time. A position can technically
      owe infinite fees if never closed or liquidated. This creates
      accounting problems and bad debt risk.
    solution: |
      # CAP ACCUMULATED FEES

      contract FeeManagement {
          uint256 public constant MAX_FEE_RATIO = 0.95e18; // 95% of collateral

          function updatePosition(address trader) public {
              Position storage pos = positions[trader];

              uint256 accumulatedFees = calculateAccumulatedFees(pos);

              // Cap fees at percentage of collateral
              uint256 maxFees = (pos.collateral * MAX_FEE_RATIO) / 1e18;
              if (accumulatedFees > maxFees) {
                  accumulatedFees = maxFees;
                  // Auto-liquidate when fees hit cap
                  _liquidate(trader);
              }

              pos.accruedFees = accumulatedFees;
          }

          // Also implement position expiry
          uint256 public constant MAX_POSITION_AGE = 365 days;

          function checkPositionAge(address trader) internal {
              Position storage pos = positions[trader];
              if (block.timestamp > pos.openTime + MAX_POSITION_AGE) {
                  _forceClose(trader);
              }
          }
      }
    symptoms:
      - Ancient positions in system
      - Fees exceeding collateral on paper
      - Accounting discrepancies

  - id: cross-margin-contagion
    summary: One bad position drains all cross-margin collateral
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Trader has 10 positions in cross-margin mode. One position
      goes heavily underwater. The system uses collateral from
      other profitable positions, liquidating everything.
    why: |
      Cross-margin shares collateral across positions. A single
      large loss can consume collateral meant for other positions,
      triggering cascading liquidations of the entire account.
