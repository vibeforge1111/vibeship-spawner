# Collaboration - Token Launch
# How this skill works with other skills

version: 1.0.0
skill_id: token-launch

prerequisites:
  required:
    - skill: smart-contract-engineer
      reason: "Token launch requires solid Solidity fundamentals"
    - skill: blockchain-defi
      reason: "Understanding DeFi mechanics for liquidity provision"

  recommended:
    - skill: smart-contract-auditor
      reason: "Security audit before launch is critical"
    - skill: dao-governance
      reason: "Many launches transition to DAO governance"

delegation_triggers:
  - condition: "Implementing complex AMM integration"
    delegate_to: defi-architect
    context: "Pass tokenomics requirements and liquidity needs"

  - condition: "Security audit of vesting contracts"
    delegate_to: smart-contract-auditor
    context: "Provide contract code and threat model"

  - condition: "Setting up DAO for treasury"
    delegate_to: dao-governance
    context: "Share token allocation and governance requirements"

  - condition: "Cross-chain token deployment"
    delegate_to: cross-chain
    context: "Provide token standards and bridge requirements"

  - condition: "On-chain analytics for launch"
    delegate_to: onchain-analytics
    context: "Share token addresses and metrics to track"

  - name: "Full Launch Stack"
    skills:
      - token-launch
      - smart-contract-auditor
      - dao-governance
      - onchain-analytics
    workflow: |
      1. Design tokenomics (token-launch)
      2. Audit contracts (smart-contract-auditor)
      3. Set up governance (dao-governance)
      4. Build monitoring (onchain-analytics)

  - name: "Multi-chain Launch"
    skills:
      - token-launch
      - cross-chain
      - wallet-integration
    workflow: |
      1. Deploy on primary chain (token-launch)
      2. Set up bridges (cross-chain)
      3. Configure wallet support (wallet-integration)

  - name: "Gaming Token Launch"
    skills:
      - token-launch
      - web3-gaming
      - nft-engineer
    workflow: |
      1. Design game tokenomics (token-launch + web3-gaming)
      2. Create NFT integration (nft-engineer)
      3. Launch token and NFTs together

handoff_data:
  provides:
    - token_contract_address
    - vesting_contract_addresses
    - tokenomics_allocation
    - launch_timestamp
    - liquidity_pool_addresses
    - unlock_schedule

  expects:
    - audit_report (from smart-contract-auditor)
    - bridge_configuration (from cross-chain)
    - governance_setup (from dao-governance)
    - wallet_sdk_integration (from wallet-integration)

integration_notes: |
  Token Launch is typically an early-stage skill that hands off to
  other skills for ongoing operations:

  - Post-launch governance → dao-governance
  - Token analytics → onchain-analytics
  - Wallet integration → wallet-integration
  - Trading features → perpetuals-trading, crypto-trading-bots

  Always complete security audit before launch. Never rush to market
  without proper vetting of all contracts.
