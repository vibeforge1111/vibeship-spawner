    summary: UserOperation rejected by bundler for subtle reasons
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Your UserOperation is valid but bundlers reject it. Reasons
      range from insufficient prefund to banned opcodes.
    why: |
      Bundlers run simulation before including UserOps. Any reason
      for potential failure or MEV extraction causes rejection.
    solution: |
      Common Rejection Reasons:
      1. Insufficient prefund (need gas * gasPrice + extra)
      2. Account not deployed and no initCode
      3. Banned opcodes in validation
      4. Storage access violations
      5. Paymaster validation failed

      // Proper gas estimation
      const gasEstimate = await bundler.estimateUserOperationGas(userOp);
      userOp.callGasLimit = gasEstimate.callGasLimit;
      userOp.verificationGasLimit = gasEstimate.verificationGasLimit;
      userOp.preVerificationGas = gasEstimate.preVerificationGas;

  - id: initcode-gas
    summary: First transaction fails due to deployment cost
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      User's first transaction includes initCode for account
      deployment. You underestimate gas, transaction fails.
    why: |
      Account deployment costs 200k-500k gas extra. First UserOp
      must cover both deployment and execution.
    solution: |
      // Add deployment overhead for first transaction
      if (isFirstTransaction) {
          userOp.verificationGasLimit += 500000n;
          userOp.preVerificationGas += 100000n;
      }

  - id: paymaster-frontrun
    summary: Paymaster approval can be front-run
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Verifying paymaster signs approval off-chain. Attacker
      intercepts signature and uses it for their own UserOp.
    why: |
      If paymaster signature doesn't bind to specific UserOp,
      it can be extracted and reused.
    solution: |
      // Include UserOp hash in paymaster signature
      bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encode(
          userOp.sender,
          userOp.nonce,
          keccak256(userOp.callData),
          userOpHash // Bind to this specific UserOp
      ));
