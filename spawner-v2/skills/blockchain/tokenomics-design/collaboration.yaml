cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Monetary Economics
    insight: Central bank inflation targeting applies to tokens
    application: Target 2-5% annual inflation for growth, not 1000%

  - domain: Game Theory
    insight: Incentive design is mechanism design problem
    application: Model agent behavior before launch

  - domain: Behavioral Economics
    insight: Loss aversion affects holder behavior
    application: Frame staking as avoiding dilution, not earning yield

  - domain: Corporate Finance
    insight: Equity vesting practices translate to tokens
    application: 4-year vest with 1-year cliff is standard for reason

  - domain: Network Economics
    insight: Metcalfe's Law applies to token networks
    application: Value grows with square of active users
