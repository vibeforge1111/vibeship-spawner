    severity: high
    title: Webhook Must Respond Within 5 Seconds
    situation: Receiving webhooks from Shopify
    symptom: |
      Webhook deliveries marked as failed.
      "Your app didn't respond in time" in Shopify logs.
      Missing order/product updates.
      Webhooks retried repeatedly then cancelled.
    why: |
      Shopify expects a 2xx response within 5 seconds. If your app processes
      the webhook data before responding, you'll timeout.

      Shopify retries failed webhooks up to 19 times over 48 hours.
      After continued failures, webhooks may be cancelled entirely.

      Heavy processing (API calls, database operations) must happen
      after the response is sent.
    solution: |
      ## Respond immediately, process asynchronously

      ```typescript
      // app/routes/webhooks.tsx
      export const action = async ({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
        const { topic, shop, payload } = await authenticate.webhook(request);

        // Queue for async processing
        await jobQueue.add("process-webhook", {
          topic,
          shop,
          payload,
        });

        // CRITICAL: Return 200 immediately
        return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
      };

      // Worker process handles the actual work
      // workers/webhook-processor.ts
      import { Worker } from "bullmq";

      const worker = new Worker("process-webhook", async (job) => {
        const { topic, shop, payload } = job.data;

        switch (topic) {
          case "ORDERS_CREATE":
            await processOrder(shop, payload);
            break;
          // ... other handlers
        }
      });
      ```

      ## For simple operations, be quick

      ```typescript
      // Simple database update is OK if fast
      export const action = async ({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
        const { topic, payload } = await authenticate.webhook(request);

        // Quick database update (< 1 second)
        await db.product.update({
          where: { shopifyId: payload.id },
          data: { title: payload.title },
        });

        return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
      };
      ```

      ## Monitor webhook performance

      ```typescript
      // Log response times
      const start = Date.now();

      await handleWebhook(payload);

      const duration = Date.now() - start;
      console.log(`Webhook processed in ${duration}ms`);

      // Alert if approaching timeout
      if (duration > 3000) {
        console.warn("Webhook processing taking too long!");
      }
      ```

  - id: api-rate-limits
    severity: high
    title: API Rate Limits Cause 429 Errors
    situation: Making API calls to Shopify
    symptom: |
      HTTP 429 Too Many Requests errors.
      "Throttled" responses.
      App becomes unresponsive.
      Operations fail silently or partially.
    why: |
      Shopify enforces strict rate limits:
      - REST: 2 requests per second per store
      - GraphQL: 1000 points per 60 seconds

      Exceeding limits causes immediate 429 errors.
      Continuous violations can result in temporary bans.

      Bulk operations count against limits.
    solution: |
      ## Check rate limit headers

      ```typescript
      // REST API
      // X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit: 39/40

      // GraphQL - check response extensions
      const response = await admin.graphql(`...`);
      const { data, extensions } = await response.json();

      const cost = extensions?.cost;
      // {
      //   "requestedQueryCost": 42,
      //   "actualQueryCost": 42,
      //   "throttleStatus": {
      //     "maximumAvailable": 1000,
      //     "currentlyAvailable": 958,
      //     "restoreRate": 50
      //   }
      // }
      ```

      ## Implement retry with exponential backoff

      ```typescript
      async function shopifyRequest(
        fn: () => Promise<Response>,
        maxRetries = 3
      ): Promise<Response> {
        let lastError: Error;

        for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
          try {
            const response = await fn();

            if (response.status === 429) {
              // Get retry-after header or default
              const retryAfter = parseInt(
                response.headers.get("Retry-After") || "2"
              );
              await sleep(retryAfter * 1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt));
              continue;
            }

            return response;
          } catch (error) {
            lastError = error as Error;
          }
        }

        throw lastError!;
      }
      ```

      ## Use bulk operations for large datasets

      ```typescript
      // Instead of 1000 individual calls, use bulk mutation
      const response = await admin.graphql(`
        mutation {
          bulkOperationRunMutation(
            mutation: "mutation($input: ProductInput!) {
              productUpdate(input: $input) { product { id } }
            }",
            stagedUploadPath: "..."
          ) {
            bulkOperation { id status }
            userErrors { message }
          }
        }
      `);
      ```

      ## Queue requests

      ```typescript
      import { RateLimiter } from "limiter";

      // 2 requests per second for REST
      const limiter = new RateLimiter({
        tokensPerInterval: 2,
        interval: "second",
      });

      async function rateLimitedRequest(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
        await limiter.removeTokens(1);
        return fn();
      }
      ```
    detection_pattern:
      - "429"
      - "rate limit"
      - "throttle"
      - "Too Many Requests"

  - id: protected-customer-data
    severity: high
    title: Protected Customer Data Requires Special Permission
    situation: Accessing customer PII in webhooks or API
    symptom: |
      Webhook deliveries fail for orders/customers.
      Customer data fields are null or empty.
      App works in development but fails in production.
      "Protected customer data access" errors.
    why: |
      Since April 2024, accessing protected customer data (PII) requires
      explicit approval from Shopify. This is separate from OAuth scopes.

      Protected data includes:
      - Customer names, emails, addresses
      - Order customer information
      - Subscription customer details

      Even with read_orders scope, you won't receive customer data
      in webhooks without protected data access.
    solution: |
      ## Request protected customer data access

      1. Go to Partner Dashboard > App > API access
      2. Under "Protected customer data access"
      3. Request access for needed data types
      4. Justify your use case
      5. Wait for Shopify approval (can take days)

      ## Check your data access level

      ```typescript
      // Query your app's data access
      const response = await admin.graphql(`
        query {
          currentAppInstallation {
            accessScopes {
              handle
            }
          }
        }
      `);
      ```

      ## Handle missing data gracefully

      ```typescript
      // Webhook payload may have redacted fields
      async function processOrder(payload: any) {
        const customerEmail = payload.customer?.email;

        if (!customerEmail) {
          // Customer data not available
          // Either no protected access or data redacted
          console.log("Customer data not available");
          return;
        }

        await sendOrderConfirmation(customerEmail);
      }
      ```

      ## Use customer account API for direct access

      ```typescript
      // If customer is logged in, can access their data
      // through Customer Account API (different from Admin API)
      ```

  - id: duplicate-webhook-definitions
    severity: medium
    title: Duplicate Webhook Definitions Cause Conflicts
    situation: Configuring webhooks in both TOML and code
    symptom: |
      Duplicate webhook deliveries.
      Some webhooks fire twice.
      Webhook subscriptions fail to register.
      Unpredictable webhook behavior.
    why: |
      Shopify apps can define webhooks in two places:
      1. shopify.app.toml (declarative, recommended)
      2. afterAuth hook in code (imperative, legacy)

      If you define the same webhook in both places, you get:
      - Duplicate subscriptions
      - Race conditions during registration
      - Conflicts during app updates
    solution: |
      ## Use TOML only (recommended)

      ```toml
      # shopify.app.toml
      [webhooks]
      api_version = "2024-10"

      [webhooks.subscriptions]
      topics = [
        "orders/create",
        "orders/updated",
        "products/create",
        "products/update",
        "app/uninstalled"
      ]
      uri = "/webhooks"
      ```

      ## Remove code-based registration

      ```typescript
      // DON'T do this if using TOML
      const shopify = shopifyApp({
        // ...
        hooks: {
          afterAuth: async ({ session }) => {
            // Remove webhook registration from here
            // Let TOML handle it
          },
        },
      });
      ```

      ## Deploy to apply TOML changes

      ```bash
      # Webhooks registered on deploy
      shopify app deploy
      ```

      ## Check current subscriptions

      ```typescript
      const response = await admin.graphql(`
        query {
          webhookSubscriptions(first: 50) {
            edges {
              node {
                id
                topic
                endpoint {
                  ... on WebhookHttpEndpoint {
                    callbackUrl
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      `);

  - id: trailing-slash-webhook-404
    severity: medium
    title: Webhook URL Trailing Slash Causes 404
    situation: Setting up webhook endpoints
    symptom: |
      Webhooks return 404 Not Found.
      Webhook delivery fails immediately.
      Works in local dev but fails in production.
      Logs show request to /webhooks/ not /webhooks.
    why: |
      Shopify automatically adds a trailing slash to webhook URLs.
      If your server doesn't handle both /webhooks and /webhooks/,
      the webhook will 404.

      Common with frameworks that are strict about trailing slashes.
    solution: |
      ## Handle both URL formats

      ```typescript
      // Remix/React Router - both work by default
      // app/routes/webhooks.tsx handles /webhooks

      // Express - add middleware
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
        if (req.path.endsWith('/') && req.path.length > 1) {
          const query = req.url.slice(req.path.length);
          const safePath = req.path.slice(0, -1);
          res.redirect(301, safePath + query);
        }
        next();
      });
      ```

      ## Configure web server

      ```nginx
      # Nginx - strip trailing slashes
      location ~ ^(.+)/$ {
        return 301 $1;
      }

      # Or rewrite to handler
      location /webhooks {
        try_files $uri $uri/ @webhooks;
      }
      location @webhooks {
        proxy_pass http://app:3000/webhooks;
      }
      ```

      ## Test both formats

      ```bash
      # Test without slash
      curl -X POST https://your-app.com/webhooks

      # Test with slash
      curl -X POST https://your-app.com/webhooks/

    severity: high
    title: REST API Required Migration to GraphQL (April 2025)
    situation: Building new public apps or maintaining existing
    symptom: |
      App store submission rejected for REST API usage.
      Deprecation warnings in console.
      Some REST endpoints stop working.
      Missing features only in GraphQL.
    why: |
      As of October 2024, REST Admin API is legacy.
      Starting April 2025, new public apps MUST use GraphQL.

      REST endpoints will continue working for existing apps,
      but new features are GraphQL-only.

      Metafields, bulk operations, and many new features
      require GraphQL.
    solution: |
      ## Use GraphQL for all new code

      ```typescript
      // REST (legacy)
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://${shop}/admin/api/2024-10/products.json`,
        {
          headers: { "X-Shopify-Access-Token": token },
        }
      );

      // GraphQL (recommended)
      const response = await admin.graphql(`
        query {
          products(first: 10) {
            edges {
              node {
                id
                title
              }
            }
          }
        }
      `);
      ```

      ## Migrate existing REST calls

      ```typescript
      // REST: GET /products/{id}.json
      // GraphQL equivalent:
      const response = await admin.graphql(`
        query GetProduct($id: ID!) {
          product(id: $id) {
            id
            title
            status
            variants(first: 10) {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  price
                  inventoryQuantity
                }
              }

        }
      `, {
        variables: { id: `gid://shopify/Product/${productId}` },
      });
      ```

      ## Use GraphQL for webhooks too

      ```toml

    title: App Bridge Required for Built for Shopify (July 2025)
    situation: Building embedded Shopify apps
    symptom: |
      App rejected from "Built for Shopify" program.
      App not appearing correctly in admin.
      Navigation and chrome issues.
      Warning about App Bridge version.
    why: |
      Effective July 2025, all apps seeking "Built for Shopify" status
      must use the latest version of App Bridge and be embedded.

      Apps using old App Bridge versions or not embedded will
      lose built for Shopify benefits (better placement, badges).

      Shopify now serves App Bridge and Polaris via unversioned
      script tags that auto-update.
    solution: |
      ## Use latest App Bridge via script tag

      ```html
      <!-- Automatically stays up to date -->
      <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js"></script>
      ```

      ## Use AppProvider in React

      ```typescript
      // app/routes/app.tsx
      import { AppProvider } from "@shopify/shopify-app-remix/react";

      export default function App() {

            <Outlet />
          </AppProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

      ## Enable embedded auth strategy

      ```typescript
      // shopify.server.ts
      const shopify = shopifyApp({
        // ...
        future: {
          unstable_newEmbeddedAuthStrategy: true,
        },
      });
      ```

      ## Check embedded status

      ```typescript
      import { useAppBridge } from "@shopify/app-bridge-react";

      function MyComponent() {
        const app = useAppBridge();

    title: Missing GDPR Webhooks Block App Store Approval
    situation: Submitting app to Shopify App Store
    symptom: |
      App submission rejected.
      "GDPR webhooks not implemented" error.
      Manual review fails for compliance.
      Data request webhooks not handled.
    why: |
      Shopify requires all apps to handle three GDPR webhooks:
      1. customers/data_request - Provide customer data
      2. customers/redact - Delete customer data
      3. shop/redact - Delete all shop data

      These are automatically subscribed when you create an app.
      You MUST implement handlers even if you don't store data.
    solution: |
      ## Implement all GDPR handlers

      ```typescript
      // app/routes/webhooks.tsx
      export const action = async ({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
        const { topic, payload, shop } = await authenticate.webhook(request);

            await handleShopRedact(shop, payload);
            break;
        }

        return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
      };

      async function handleDataRequest(shop: string, payload: any) {
        const customerId = payload.customer.id;

        // Return customer data within 30 days
        // Usually send to data_request.destination_url
        const customerData = await db.customer.findUnique({
          where: { shopifyId: customerId, shop },
        });

        if (customerData) {
          // Send to provided URL or email
          await sendDataToMerchant(payload.data_request, customerData);
        }
      }

      async function handleCustomerRedact(shop: string, payload: any) {
        const customerId = payload.customer.id;

        // Delete customer's personal data
        await db.customer.deleteMany({
          where: { shopifyId: customerId, shop },
        });

        await db.order.updateMany({
          where: { customerId, shop },
          data: { customerEmail: null, customerName: null },
        });
      }

      async function handleShopRedact(shop: string, payload: any) {
        // Shop uninstalled 48+ hours ago
        // Delete ALL data for this shop
        await db.session.deleteMany({ where: { shop } });
        await db.customer.deleteMany({ where: { shop } });
        await db.order.deleteMany({ where: { shop } });
        await db.settings.deleteMany({ where: { shop } });
      }
      ```

      case "CUSTOMERS_DATA_REQUEST":
      case "CUSTOMERS_REDACT":
      case "SHOP_REDACT":
        // No data stored, but must acknowledge
        console.log(`GDPR ${topic} for ${shop} - no data stored`);
        break;
