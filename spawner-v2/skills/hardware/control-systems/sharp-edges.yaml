    title: "Wrong PID Tuning Order Causes Oscillation"
    summary: "Tuning I before P, or D before I, leads to instability"
    symptoms:
      - "System oscillates at any gain setting"
      - "Increasing gain makes things worse"
      - "Controller never stabilizes"
    why: |
      PID terms interact. Tuning in wrong order creates instability:

      - P alone: Proportional response, steady-state error
      - I without P: Phase lag, guaranteed oscillation
      - D without P: Amplifies noise, no steady tracking

      Correct order: P first (for response), then I (eliminate error),
      finally D (reduce overshoot).

      Starting with I or having too much I relative to P
      causes phase lag that leads to oscillation.
    gotcha: |
      # Common mistake: Starting with integral
      pid = PIDController(kp=0, ki=10, kd=0)  # Will oscillate!

      # Or: Too much I relative to P
      pid = PIDController(kp=1, ki=100, kd=0)  # Integral dominates, oscillates
    solution: |
      # Systematic tuning procedure
      # 1. Set I = 0, D = 0, increase P until oscillation
      pid = PIDController(kp=0, ki=0, kd=0)

      # Find critical gain (Ku) where oscillation starts
      for kp in np.linspace(0, 100, 100):
          pid.gains.kp = kp
          # Test and check for sustained oscillation

      # 2. Use Ziegler-Nichols or similar method
      ku = 50  # Critical gain
      tu = 0.5  # Oscillation period

      # PID: kp = 0.6*ku, ki = 1.2*ku/tu, kd = 0.075*ku*tu
      gains = ziegler_nichols_tuning(ku, tu, 'PID')

      # 3. Fine-tune from there
      # Reduce I if overshoot, increase D if oscillating

    title: "Continuous PID Formulas Don't Work at Low Sample Rates"
    summary: "Textbook PID formulas assume continuous time, fail when sampled slowly"
    symptoms:
      - "Controller works at 1kHz, fails at 100Hz"
      - "Derivative term is noisy or wrong"
      - "Integral accumulates incorrectly"
    why: |
      Continuous PID: u = Kp*e + Ki*integral(e) + Kd*de/dt

      Discrete implementation matters:
      - Integral: Euler vs trapezoidal vs exact
      - Derivative: Forward vs backward vs filtered

      At low sample rates, these differences are significant.
      Bilinear (Tustin) transform preserves stability better
      than simple Euler integration.
    gotcha: |
      # Simple Euler integration
      self.integral += error * dt
      derivative = (error - self.prev_error) / dt  # Noisy!

      # Works at 1kHz, fails at 50Hz
    solution: |
      # Use proper discrete-time formulation

      # 1. Trapezoidal integration (more accurate)
      self.integral += 0.5 * (error + self.prev_error) * dt

      # 2. Filtered derivative (reduces noise)
      # First-order filter: d_filt = alpha * d_raw + (1-alpha) * d_prev
      tau_d = 0.1  # Filter time constant
      alpha = dt / (tau_d + dt)
      d_raw = (error - self.prev_error) / dt
      d_filtered = alpha * d_raw + (1 - alpha) * self.prev_derivative

      # 3. Or use bilinear transform for entire controller
      # s -> 2/T * (z-1)/(z+1)

      # 4. Derivative on measurement, not error
      d_raw = -(measurement - self.prev_measurement) / dt

    title: "MPC Model Mismatch Causes Poor Performance"
    summary: "MPC relies on accurate model; errors cause suboptimal or unstable control"
    symptoms:
      - "MPC works in simulation, fails on real system"
      - "Controller is sluggish or oscillatory"
      - "Constraints violated despite MPC"
    why: |
      MPC optimizes based on predicted future states.
      If the model is wrong, predictions are wrong,
      and the "optimal" control is actually suboptimal.

      Common model errors:
      - Wrong time constants
      - Unmodeled friction/backlash
      - Linearization at wrong operating point
      - Ignored coupling between axes

      MPC is more sensitive to model errors than PID
      because it plans ahead based on the model.
    gotcha: |
      # MPC with nominal model
      Ad_nominal = np.array([[1, 0.1], [0, 1]])  # Assumes no friction

      mpc = LinearMPC(Ad_nominal, Bd, params)

      # Real system has friction - model predicts wrong trajectory
      # MPC optimizes for wrong predictions
    solution: |
      # 1. System identification
      from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

      def system_response(t, tau, K):
          return K * (1 - np.exp(-t/tau))

      # Fit model to step response data
      params, _ = curve_fit(system_response, t_data, y_data)

      # 2. Add disturbance estimation
      class DisturbanceObserver:
          """Estimate and compensate for model mismatch."""
          def __init__(self, model):
              self.model = model
              self.d_hat = 0  # Estimated disturbance

          def update(self, x, x_predicted, L=0.5):
              # Disturbance = difference between prediction and reality
              self.d_hat = L * self.d_hat + (1-L) * (x - x_predicted)
              return self.d_hat

    title: "Control Loop Sample Rate Too Low"
    summary: "Slow sample rate causes phase lag and instability"
    symptoms:
      - "System oscillates at high frequencies"
      - "Controller can't track fast references"
      - "Adding D gain makes oscillation worse"
    why: |
      Rule of thumb: sample rate should be 10-20x the
      system's fastest dynamics (bandwidth).

      For motor control:
      - Current loop: 10-20 kHz
      - Velocity loop: 1-10 kHz
      - Position loop: 100-1000 Hz

      Too slow sampling adds phase lag, reducing stability margins.
      It also aliases high-frequency disturbances.
    gotcha: |
      # Motor position control at 10 Hz
      while True:
          time.sleep(0.1)  # 10 Hz - WAY too slow for motors
          u = pid.update(setpoint, position)
          motor.set_command(u)

      # Motor dynamics are ~100Hz, need at least 1kHz control
    solution: |
      # 1. Use hardware timer for precise control loop
      def timer_isr():
          """1kHz control interrupt."""
          global position, setpoint
          u = pid.update(setpoint, position)
          motor.set_pwm(u)

      setup_timer_interrupt(frequency=1000, callback=timer_isr)

      # 2. Separate fast and slow loops
      # Fast: current/velocity (hardware timer, 1-10kHz)
      # Slow: position/trajectory (software, 100-500Hz)

      # 3. For ROS2: Use realtime-safe callback groups
      from rclpy.callback_groups import RealtimeCallbackGroup

      self.control_timer = self.create_timer(
          0.001,  # 1ms = 1kHz
          self.control_callback,
          callback_group=RealtimeCallbackGroup()
      )

  - id: actuator-saturation
    severity: high
    title: "Ignoring Actuator Saturation"
    summary: "Controller commands exceed physical limits, causes windup and instability"
    symptoms:
      - "Large overshoot on step response"
      - "Slow recovery after large errors"
      - "Oscillation after hitting limits"
    why: |
      Every actuator has limits:
      - Motors: max current, max voltage
      - Servos: max position, max velocity
      - Pumps: max flow rate

      If controller outputs exceed these, the actuator saturates.
      The controller keeps integrating error, causing windup.
      When error reduces, the accumulated integral causes overshoot.

      MPC handles this naturally via constraints.
      PID needs explicit anti-windup.
    gotcha: |
      # PID without output limits
      pid = PIDController(gains, dt)  # No limits!

      u = pid.update(setpoint, measurement)  # Could be 1000V
      motor.set_voltage(u)  # Motor saturates at 24V

      # Integral keeps growing during saturation
      # Huge overshoot when setpoint reached
    solution: |
      # 1. Clamp output and implement anti-windup
      pid = PIDController(
          gains, dt,
          output_limits=(-24.0, 24.0)  # Voltage limits
      )

      # 2. Back-calculation anti-windup
      output_unsat = p + i + d
      output = np.clip(output_unsat, -24, 24)
      if ki != 0:
          anti_windup = (output - output_unsat) / ki
          integral += anti_windup

      # 3. Conditional integration
      if not saturated:
          integral += error * dt
      # Don't integrate while saturated

      # 4. Use MPC with explicit constraints
      mpc = LinearMPC(
          A, B, params,
          u_min=np.array([-24.0]),
          u_max=np.array([24.0])
      )

  - id: setpoint-jump
    severity: medium
    title: "Setpoint Jump Causes Actuator Stress"
    summary: "Step changes in setpoint cause aggressive control action"
    symptoms:
      - "Motor jerks on setpoint change"
      - "Mechanical stress and wear"
      - "Overshoot on step response"
    why: |
      Derivative term amplifies sudden changes.
      Step change in setpoint = infinite derivative = kick.

      Even without D, large step = large error = aggressive P action.
      This stresses mechanical systems and can cause vibration.
    solution: |
      # 1. Derivative on measurement (not error)
      derivative = -(measurement - prev_measurement) / dt
      # Not: derivative = (error - prev_error) / dt

      # 2. Setpoint ramping/filtering
      class SetpointFilter:
          def __init__(self, rate_limit, dt):
              self.rate = rate_limit
              self.dt = dt
              self.filtered = 0

          def update(self, setpoint):
              delta = setpoint - self.filtered
              max_delta = self.rate * self.dt
              delta = np.clip(delta, -max_delta, max_delta)
              self.filtered += delta
              return self.filtered

      # 3. Use trajectory generator
      # Instead of step: use minimum-jerk or trapezoidal profile

      # 4. Setpoint weighting (P acts on weighted setpoint)
      # u = Kp * (b * setpoint - measurement) + ...
      # b < 1 reduces kick
