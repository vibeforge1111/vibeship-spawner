    severity: critical
    title: "Metastability from Missing CDC Synchronizer"
    summary: "Signals crossing clock domains without synchronization cause random failures"
    symptoms:
      - "Random bit flips in data"
      - "FSM enters invalid state"
      - "Works on some boards, fails on others"
      - "Failures increase with temperature"
    why: |
      When a signal changes near a clock edge, the flip-flop may
      enter a metastable state - neither 0 nor 1.

      This takes time to resolve (settling time). If another
      flip-flop samples before resolution, you get random values.

      Single-bit: Use 2-FF synchronizer
      Multi-bit: Use async FIFO with Gray code pointers
      Pulse: Convert to toggle, synchronize, edge-detect

      CDC bugs are the #1 cause of "random" FPGA failures.
    gotcha: |
      // WRONG: Direct connection across clock domains
      always @(posedge clk_b) begin
          data_b <= data_a;  // data_a is in clk_a domain!
          // Metastability! Random values!
      end
    solution: |
      // CORRECT: Use 2-FF synchronizer for single bit
      (* ASYNC_REG = "TRUE" *)
      reg [1:0] sync_chain;

      always @(posedge clk_b) begin
          sync_chain <= {sync_chain[0], signal_a};
      end
      assign signal_b = sync_chain[1];

      // For multi-bit data: use async FIFO
      async_fifo #(.DATA_WIDTH(8)) fifo (
          .wr_clk(clk_a), .wr_data(data_a),
          .rd_clk(clk_b), .rd_data(data_b)
      );

  - id: latch-inference
    severity: critical
    title: "Unintentional Latch Inference"
    summary: "Incomplete if/case creates latch instead of flip-flop"
    symptoms:
      - "Synthesis warning: 'latch inferred'"
      - "Timing analysis fails"
      - "Unexpected behavior after synthesis"
    why: |
      In combinational logic, if a signal isn't assigned in all
      branches, synthesis infers a latch to hold the previous value.

      Latches are:
      - Hard to analyze timing for
      - Not available in all FPGA architectures
      - Often indicate a design error

      Almost always, you wanted a flip-flop or a complete assignment.
    gotcha: |
      // WRONG: Missing else creates latch
      always @(*) begin
          if (enable)
              data_out = data_in;
          // What happens when enable=0? Latch!
      end

      // WRONG: Incomplete case creates latch
      always @(*) begin
          case (sel)
              2'b00: y = a;
              2'b01: y = b;
              // Missing 2'b10, 2'b11 cases - latch!
          endcase
      end
    solution: |
      // CORRECT: Assign default at start
      always @(*) begin
          data_out = 8'h00;  // Default value
          if (enable)
              data_out = data_in;
      end

      // CORRECT: Complete case with default
      always @(*) begin
          case (sel)
              2'b00: y = a;
              2'b01: y = b;
              default: y = 8'h00;  // Catch-all
          endcase
      end

      // CORRECT: Use full_case/parallel_case pragmas carefully
      // (* full_case *) only if you guarantee coverage

  - id: timing-closure
    severity: critical
    title: "Timing Closure Failure"
    summary: "Design doesn't meet timing constraints, unreliable operation"
    symptoms:
      - "Negative slack in timing report"
      - "Works at low temperature, fails when warm"
      - "Works on some units, fails on others"
    why: |
      Timing closure means all paths meet setup/hold requirements.

      Common causes of failure:
      - Long combinational paths (too much logic between FFs)
      - High fanout signals (driving many loads)
      - Clock skew/uncertainty
      - Missing or incorrect constraints

      Negative slack = path too slow = unreliable operation.
    gotcha: |
      // WRONG: Long combinational path
      always @(*) begin
          // 20 levels of logic - will never meet 100MHz timing
          result = ((a * b) + (c * d)) * ((e + f) / g) + h;
      end
    solution: |
      // CORRECT: Pipeline long operations
      always @(posedge clk) begin
          // Stage 1
          mult1 <= a * b;
          mult2 <= c * d;

          // Stage 2
          sum1 <= mult1 + mult2;
          sum2 <= e + f;

          // Stage 3
          result <= sum1 + (sum2 * h);  // Simplified
      end

      // Reduce fanout with register duplication
      // Let synthesis tool handle with: set_max_fanout 32

      // Add proper timing constraints
      // create_clock -period 10.0 [get_ports clk]

  - id: reset-glitch
    severity: high
    title: "Asynchronous Reset Release Glitch"
    summary: "Releasing reset asynchronously causes metastability"
    symptoms:
      - "FSM starts in wrong state after reset"
      - "Different behavior on different resets"
      - "Works most of the time, occasionally fails"
    why: |
      Asserting reset asynchronously is fine - it immediately resets.
      But RELEASING reset at an arbitrary time can violate
      recovery/removal timing on flip-flops.

      Solution: Assert asynchronously, release synchronously.
      This gives the reset assertion benefit (immediate) while
      ensuring clean release aligned to clock.
    gotcha: |
      // WRONG: Fully asynchronous reset
      always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
          if (!rst_n)
              state <= IDLE;
          else
              state <= next_state;
      end
      // Reset release can cause metastability!
    solution: |
      // CORRECT: Reset synchronizer
      // Async assert, sync release

      module reset_sync (
          input  wire clk,
          input  wire rst_n_async,
          output wire rst_n_sync
      );
          reg [1:0] sync;

          always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n_async) begin
              if (!rst_n_async)
                  sync <= 2'b00;  // Async assert
              else
                  sync <= {sync[0], 1'b1};  // Sync release
          end

          assign rst_n_sync = sync[1];
      endmodule

      // Use synchronized reset in design
      reset_sync rst_sync (.clk(clk), .rst_n_async(rst_n), .rst_n_sync(rst_n_safe));

  - id: simulation-synthesis-mismatch
    severity: high
    title: "Simulation-Synthesis Mismatch"
    summary: "Design works in simulation but fails on FPGA"
    symptoms:
      - "Testbench passes, hardware fails"
      - "Adding signals to debug changes behavior"
      - "Different results from simulation and implementation"
    why: |
      Common causes:
      1. Non-synthesizable constructs (initial blocks, delays)
      2. Incomplete sensitivity lists
      3. Blocking vs non-blocking assignment confusion
      4. X-propagation differences
      5. Timing assumptions in testbench

      Simulation is behavior model; synthesis creates actual hardware.
    gotcha: |
      // WRONG: Initial blocks don't synthesize
      initial begin
          count = 0;  // Only works in simulation!
      end

      // WRONG: Incomplete sensitivity list
      always @(a or b) begin
          y = a & b & c;  // c not in sensitivity list!
          // Simulation: y updates on a or b change
          // Synthesis: combinational logic, updates on any change
      end

      // WRONG: Blocking in sequential, non-blocking in combinational
      always @(posedge clk) begin
          a = b;  // Should be <=
          c = a;  // Gets NEW value of a (race condition)
      end
    solution: |
      // CORRECT: Use reset instead of initial
      always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
          if (!rst_n)
              count <= 0;
          else
              count <= count + 1;
      end

      // CORRECT: Use @(*) for combinational
      always @(*) begin  // All signals in sensitivity list
          y = a & b & c;
      end

      // CORRECT: Non-blocking for sequential
      always @(posedge clk) begin
          a <= b;  // Non-blocking
          c <= a;  // Gets OLD value of a
      end

  - id: resource-exhaustion
    severity: high
    title: "FPGA Resource Exhaustion"
    summary: "Design uses more resources than available"
    symptoms:
      - "Synthesis fails with 'resource exceeded'"
      - "Timing degrades as utilization increases"
      - "Can't fit design even at lower clock speed"
    why: |
      FPGAs have limited:
      - LUTs (logic)
      - FFs (registers)
      - BRAM (block RAM)
      - DSP slices (multipliers)

      Over ~70-80% utilization, place-and-route struggles.
      Common causes: unintended resource usage, inefficient coding.
    solution: |
      // Check resource usage in synthesis reports

      // Efficient resource usage:
      // 1. Use BRAM instead of distributed RAM for large memories
      (* ram_style = "block" *) reg [7:0] mem [0:1023];

      // 2. Share multipliers via time-division
      always @(posedge clk) begin
          case (phase)
              0: product <= a * b;  // Reuse same DSP
              1: product <= c * d;
          endcase
      end

      // 3. Use inference patterns tools recognize
      // Let synthesis optimize instead of manual optimization

      // 4. Reduce bit widths where possible
      reg [7:0] counter;  // Not reg [31:0] if you only count to 100
