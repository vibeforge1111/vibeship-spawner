    Video Directing works at the center of the creative hub, providing vision
    and intent to all other execution skills. The director doesn't do everything—
    they orchestrate everything. This skill delegates execution while maintaining
    creative control.

  prerequisites:
    required: []
    recommended:
      - video-scriptwriting  # Strong scripts make directing easier
      - ai-creative-director # For larger campaigns with multiple outputs

  cross_domain_insights:
    - from: cinematography
      insight: The lens you choose is a character decision, not just a technical one
      application: Wide lens = isolation, distortion, unease. Telephoto = intimacy, compression, surveillance.

    - from: theater-direction
      insight: Blocking is storytelling—where characters stand reveals their relationships
      application: Use physical space to show power dynamics, emotional distance, alliances.

    - from: music-conducting
      insight: Rhythm and tempo are as important as notes
      application: Editing rhythm creates emotional experience. Fast cuts = tension. Long takes = meditation.

    - from: architecture
      insight: Negative space is as important as filled space
      application: What you don't show is as powerful as what you show. Leave room for imagination.

    - from: psychology
      insight: Faces are where humans look—we're wired to read expressions
      application: When in doubt, show the face. Spielberg's genius is the reaction shot.

    - from: dance-choreography
      insight: Movement has grammar—acceleration, deceleration, stillness all mean something
      application: Camera movement and subject movement should have intention and variation.

  anti_collaboration:
    - pattern: Director tries to do the editing
      why_avoid: Different skills; editor needs freedom to interpret
      instead: Provide clear vision, then trust the editor. Notes, not control.

    - pattern: Director ignores script and "finds it in the moment"
      why_avoid: No map leads to wandering; story structure matters
      instead: Start with script. Deviation should be intentional, not lazy.

    - pattern: Director gives AI prompts without clear vision
      why_avoid: AI generates options, not decisions; garbage in, garbage out
      instead: Know exactly what you want before asking AI to create it.
