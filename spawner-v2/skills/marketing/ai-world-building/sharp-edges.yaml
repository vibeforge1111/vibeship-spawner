    summary: Creating assets without underlying world rules
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Generating multiple assets for a brand world without first establishing
      the rules that govern consistency. Each new asset becomes a gamble.
    why: |
      World building is about rules, not assets. Without a system, every new
      image is a new opportunity for inconsistency. You end up with 50 images
      that look like they came from 50 different brands.
    solution: |
      RULES BEFORE ASSETS:

      1. WORLD BIBLE FIRST:
         - Before generating a single final asset
         - Document the rules
         - Visual foundation, character rules, environment language
         - What's included AND what's excluded

      2. TEST GENERATION:
         - Generate 10-20 test images using rules
         - Check for coherence
         - Refine rules based on results
         - Don't ship until test batch is consistent

      3. RULE DOCUMENTATION:
         - Specific, not vague
         "Soft warm lighting" → "5500K, diffused from upper left, soft shadows"
         - Quantify where possible
         - Visual examples for each rule

      # System → Assets, not Assets → Hope for consistency
    symptoms:
      - Every asset looks different
      - Can't describe the world in specific terms
      - New team members can't generate consistent work
      - '"Which version is right?" discussions'

  - id: verbal-only-world-bible
    summary: Describing world in words without visual references
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Creating world documentation that's all text, no images. Expecting teams
      to generate consistent visuals from written descriptions alone.
    why: |
      "Warm, inviting atmosphere" means different things to different people.
      Words are ambiguous for visual concepts. Visual consistency requires
      visual documentation. The world bible needs to SHOW, not just tell.
    solution: |
      VISUAL-FIRST DOCUMENTATION:

      EVERY RULE NEEDS:
      - Written description
      - 2-3 visual examples showing it correctly
      - 1-2 visual examples showing it incorrectly
      - "This, not that" comparisons

      WORLD BIBLE STRUCTURE:
      - 70% visual, 30% text
      - Reference images for everything
      - Annotated images explaining decisions
      - Before/after comparisons

      AI GENERATION FOR DOCUMENTATION:
      - Generate the examples using AI
      - Show the rule in action
      - Create positive and negative examples
      - Build reference library

      # Show the world, don't just describe it
    symptoms:
      - Different interpretations of same rule
      - Constant questions about visuals
      - Inconsistent team output
      - "That's not what I imagined"

  - id: ignoring-exclusions
    summary: Defining what's in the world but not what's out
    severity: high
    situation: |
      World bible describes what should appear but doesn't define what should
      NEVER appear. Half the world is undefined.
    why: |
      Worlds are defined as much by their boundaries as their content. Without
      explicit exclusions, random elements creep in. "No neon colors" is as
      important as "earth tones." Boundaries are what make a world feel like a world.
    solution: |
      EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS:

      FOR EVERY ELEMENT, DEFINE:
      - What it IS
      - What it is NOT
      - What NEVER appears

      EXCLUSION CATEGORIES:
      - Colors that NEVER appear
      - Materials that don't exist in this world
      - Objects that break the vibe
      - Styles that clash
      - Actions characters NEVER do
      - Settings that don't fit

      DOCUMENTATION FORMAT:
      "Characters ALWAYS: [list]"
      "Characters NEVER: [list]"

      "Environment INCLUDES: [list]"
      "Environment EXCLUDES: [list]"

      NEGATIVE PROMPTS:
      - Compile exclusions into negative prompts
      - Use in all generation
      - Update as new exclusions discovered

      # The world is as much what's missing as what's there
    symptoms:
      - Random elements appearing in assets
      - "That doesn't feel right but I can't say why"
      - Inconsistent vibes across assets
      - Gradual world drift

  - id: character-without-sheet
    summary: Creating recurring characters without model sheets
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Generating images of characters that need to appear consistently across
      many assets, without creating reference sheets first.
    why: |
      AI generation without reference = different character every time. Same
      prompt can generate completely different faces, builds, outfits. Characters
      need systematic documentation: multiple angles, expressions, outfits,
      all generated and approved before production use.
    solution: |
      CHARACTER MODEL SHEET SYSTEM:

      BEFORE USING CHARACTER:
      1. Generate reference sheet:
         - Front view (neutral)
         - 3/4 view
         - Side profile
         - Multiple expressions
         - Signature outfit(s)
         - Key poses

      2. Create text description:
         "[Name], [age], [physical description], [clothing], [distinguishing features]"
         Include what they NEVER wear/do

      3. Consistency techniques:
         - Same seed base for related generations
         - Reference images (IP-Adapter, ControlNet)
         - LoRA training for important characters
         - Detailed negative prompts

      4. Test consistency:
         - Generate 20 test images
         - Compare to reference sheet
         - Refine description until consistent

      # Character = System, not single image
    symptoms:
      - Character looks different each image
      - Can't generate character doing new things
      - Team generates different versions
      - Audience notices inconsistency

  - id: tool-dependent-world
    summary: Building world around specific AI tool capabilities
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Creating world rules that only work in one AI tool (e.g., Midjourney v6).
      World documentation uses tool-specific syntax, not universal concepts.
    why: |
      AI tools change constantly. Midjourney v7 will work differently. New
      better tools will emerge. If your world is described in tool-specific
      terms, you'll have to rebuild when tools change. World should be
      described universally, with tool-specific translations.
    solution: |
      TOOL-AGNOSTIC WORLD DEFINITION:

      WORLD BIBLE STRUCTURE:
      1. Universal description (tool-agnostic)
         "Soft, warm lighting from upper left, 5500K color temperature"

      2. Tool-specific translations:
         Midjourney: "--style raw --no harsh shadows"
         DALL-E: "natural lighting, warm color palette"
         Stable Diffusion: "soft_lighting, golden_hour, key_light_left"

      3. Reference images (not prompts):
         - Visual examples of correct output
         - Tool-agnostic targets to match

      WHEN TOOL CHANGES:
      - Update translation layer only
      - World definition stays same
      - Test new translations against references

      # World is concept. Prompts are translation.
    symptoms:
      - Panic when tool updates
      - World feels different in different tools
      - Documentation full of prompt syntax
      - Can't explain world without mentioning tools

  - id: over-complex-world
    summary: Creating worlds too complex to maintain consistency
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Building elaborate worlds with dozens of characters, locations, rules.
      More complexity than anyone can track or maintain.
    why: |
      Complexity is the enemy of consistency. More elements = more opportunities
      for inconsistency. More rules = harder to remember them all. Small,
      tight worlds can scale. Complex worlds collapse under their own weight.
    solution: |
      COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT:

      TIER SYSTEM:
      Tier 1 (CORE): 3-5 elements, immutable
        - Main character(s)
        - Key location(s)
        - Visual foundation
        - Never changes

      Tier 2 (EXTENDED): 5-10 elements, careful growth
        - Secondary characters
        - Additional locations
        - Requires approval to add

      Tier 3 (CAMPAIGN): Temporary, disposable
        - Seasonal elements
        - Campaign-specific characters
        - Can break some rules

      RULES:
      - Start with Tier 1 only
      - Earn complexity through consistency
      - Each new element must be justified
      - Remove unused elements
      - Simplify when possible

      # Small and consistent > large and chaotic
    symptoms:
      - Can't remember all the rules
      - Elements rarely appear consistently
      - Team overwhelmed by documentation
      - Drift becomes inevitable

  - id: one-time-world-building
    summary: Creating world bible and never updating it
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Treating world bible as finished document. Not updating as lessons
      learned, world expands, or rules need refinement.
    why: |
      Worlds are living systems. As you generate more assets, you learn what
      works. Rules need refinement. New elements are added. Documentation that
      doesn't evolve becomes irrelevant, and teams stop using it.
    solution: |
      LIVING WORLD BIBLE:

      REGULAR UPDATES:
      - Monthly review of world bible
      - Document lessons learned
      - Refine unclear rules
      - Add new elements formally
      - Remove unused elements

      LEARNING CAPTURE:
      After each production:
      - What worked?
      - What needed multiple attempts?
      - What rules were unclear?
      - What new elements emerged?

      VERSION CONTROL:
      - Date all versions
      - Track changes
      - Archive old versions
      - Changelog for major updates

      TEAM INPUT:
      - Anyone using world can suggest updates
      - Regular world bible reviews with team
      - Incorporate edge cases discovered in production

      # Document is alive. Update it.
    symptoms:
      - Documentation doesn't match practice
      - "We don't do it that way anymore"
      - New team members have outdated info
      - Tribal knowledge vs written rules

  - id: environment-as-backdrop
    summary: Treating environments as backgrounds, not characters
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Creating environments only as "where things happen" without the same
      systematic treatment given to characters. Inconsistent locations.
    why: |
      Environments are characters. A brand's spaces should be as recognizable
      and consistent as its people. If the same room looks different each time,
      the world feels incoherent. Environments need the same documentation
      rigor as characters.
    solution: |
      ENVIRONMENT AS CHARACTER:

      ENVIRONMENT SHEETS (like character sheets):
      - Overall view
      - Multiple angles
      - Detail shots
      - Different lighting conditions
      - Different times of day (if applicable)

      ENVIRONMENT DOCUMENTATION:
      - Architectural language
      - Materials palette
      - Lighting conditions
      - Props that appear/don't appear
      - Scale and proportions
      - Atmosphere/mood

      CONSISTENCY TECHNIQUES:
      - Reference images for each location
      - ControlNet for spatial consistency
      - Material/texture libraries
      - Lighting references

      RECOGNITION TEST:
      "Would someone recognize this as the same place?"
      If no → more documentation needed

      # Spaces are as important as faces
    symptoms:
      - '"Same" location looks different'
      - Environments feel generic
      - Can''t describe brand''s spaces
      - Location inconsistency ruins immersion

  - id: ai-generation-lottery
    summary: Generating until something looks right vs. systematic approach
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Treating AI generation as lottery—keep generating until something
      acceptable appears, rather than systematic rule-following approach.
    why: |
      Random generation = random results. You might get something good, but
      it won't be consistent. Each session starts fresh. Systematic approach
      (rules, references, seeds, training) produces reliable, consistent output.
    solution: |
      SYSTEMATIC GENERATION:

      BEFORE GENERATING:
      1. Check world bible for relevant rules
      2. Gather reference images
      3. Build prompt from template
      4. Set parameters (seed, style, etc.)

      DURING GENERATION:
      1. Generate batch of 4-10
      2. Compare to reference
      3. Adjust prompt systematically
      4. Document what works
      5. Save successful seeds/settings

      AFTER GENERATING:
      1. Log successful approach
      2. Update prompt library
      3. Add to reference collection
      4. Note any rule refinements needed

      LOTTERY SIGNS:
      - "Keep generating until..."
      - No reference checking
      - Every session starts fresh
      - No documentation of what worked

      # System > Luck
    symptoms:
      - Hours spent generating
      - Can't reproduce good results
      - Inconsistent output quality
      - Each session starts from scratch

  - id: style-guide-not-code
    summary: Treating style guide as suggestions vs. rules
    severity: low
    situation: |
      World bible treated as inspiration rather than strict rules.
      "Guidelines" that are regularly ignored for convenience.
    why: |
      Style guides work when they're treated as code—constraints that must be
      followed. When they become "suggestions," they lose power. Consistency
      requires discipline. The world bible is law, not advice.
    solution: |
      STYLE GUIDE AS CODE:

      MANDATORY ELEMENTS:
      - These MUST appear (no exceptions)
      - Checklist for every asset
      - Pre-publish verification

      FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS:
      - These NEVER appear (no exceptions)
      - Automated detection if possible
      - Rejection if violated

      ENFORCEMENT:
      - Review process against world bible
      - Checklist for compliance
      - Authority to reject non-compliant work
      - No "just this once" exceptions

      CULTURE:
      - World bible is law
      - Compliance is expected
      - Violations are fixed, not ignored
      - Updates go through formal process

      # Rules without enforcement aren't rules
    symptoms:
      - Frequent exceptions made
      - "Style guide is just a guideline"
      - Inconsistent enforcement
      - World drift accelerates
