    summary: Starting video with logo, greeting, or slow build
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Script begins with logo animation, "Hi, I'm..." introduction, or slow
      establishing shots. The first 3 seconds don't grab attention.
    why: |
      The first 3 seconds determine if anyone watches. Attention is earned
      in milliseconds. Starting with logo or pleasantries = scroll. 47% of
      brand value is delivered in the first 3 seconds. Hook or die.
    solution: |
      HOOK FIRST, ALWAYS:

      KILL THESE OPENINGS:
      - Logo animations
      - "Hi, I'm [Name] from [Company]"
      - "Today we're going to talk about..."
      - Slow establishing shots
      - Context setting

      HOOK TECHNIQUES:
      - Pattern interrupt (unexpected visual/sound)
      - Bold claim ("This changed everything...")
      - Direct challenge ("You're doing X wrong")
      - Question ("What if you could...")
      - Shocking statistic
      - Conflict/tension immediately
      - Visual transformation

      TIMING:
      - Hook MUST happen by second 3
      - Ideally by second 1-2
      - Logo at END, not beginning
      - Introduction AFTER hook earns it

      TEST:
      Watch your first 3 seconds on mute.
      Would YOU stop scrolling?

      # Hook first. Logo last.
    symptoms:
      - High drop-off in first 3 seconds
      - Low completion rates
      - \'"Boring" feedback\'
      - Immediate scroll-past

  - id: wall-of-words
    summary: Too much dialogue/VO for the time available
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Script has so much voiceover or dialogue that visuals become
      secondary. Talking head explains while audience glazes over.
    why: |
      Video is visual medium. Words are expensive—every second of talking
      is a second not showing. Audiences process visuals faster than audio.
      Word-heavy videos feel like podcasts with pictures.
    solution: |
      WORD COUNT LIMITS:

      6 seconds: ~15 words MAX
      15 seconds: ~40 words MAX
      30 seconds: ~75 words MAX
      60 seconds: ~150 words MAX

      REWRITE PROCESS:
      1. Write first draft
      2. Cut word count by 50%
      3. Replace words with visuals
      4. Cut another 25%
      5. Read aloud—does it breathe?

      VISUAL REPLACEMENT:
      Instead of saying "easy to use"
      → Show someone using it easily

      Instead of explaining the benefit
      → Show the benefit happening

      THE MUTE TEST:
      Cover your script's audio column.
      Does the visual column tell the story?
      If no, you have too many words.

      # Show more, say less
    symptoms:
      - Script reads like essay
      - Visuals are "B-roll" not story
      - Feels rushed when spoken
      - No breathing room

  - id: sound-only-story
    summary: Script that makes no sense on mute
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Video relies entirely on audio to tell story. On mute (autoplay),
      viewer sees random visuals with no narrative.
    why: |
      Most social platforms autoplay muted. LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram
      feed—all start silent. If your story requires sound, you've lost
      the majority of impressions before they even start.
    solution: |
      DESIGN FOR MUTE FIRST:

      THE MUTE TEST:
      1. Watch your video on mute
      2. Can you understand the message?
      3. Would you turn sound on?
      4. If no → redesign

      MUTE-FRIENDLY TECHNIQUES:
      - Text overlays for key points
      - Visual storytelling that works alone
      - Captions (always)
      - Expressive visuals
      - On-screen graphics
      - Before/after visuals

      SCRIPT STRUCTURE:
      - Write visual story first
      - Audio should ENHANCE, not carry
      - Everything essential = on screen
      - Audio adds emotion/polish

      CAPTION PLANNING:
      - Build captions into script
      - Not just transcription
      - Designed text that enhances
      - Readable at scroll speed

      # If it doesn't work muted, it doesn't work
    symptoms:
      - Low engagement on social
      - \'"What was that about?" when muted\'
      - Captions as afterthought
      - Story only in voiceover

  - id: vague-visual-descriptions
    summary: Script says "show product" instead of specific visuals
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Visual descriptions in script are vague: "Show the dashboard,"
      "Lifestyle imagery," "Product in use." Production team has no
      specific direction.
    why: |
      Scripts are blueprints. Vague blueprints = vague buildings. Production
      (human or AI) needs specific direction. "Show dashboard" could mean
      1000 different shots. Specificity enables execution.
    solution: |
      SPECIFIC VISUAL DESCRIPTIONS:

      VAGUE → SPECIFIC:
      "Show the dashboard"
      → "Dashboard fills screen. Mouse clicks 'Reports' tab.
         Revenue graph animates upward. Green +47% appears."

      "Lifestyle imagery"
      → "Sarah at standing desk, laptop open. Afternoon sunlight
         through window. Coffee steaming next to keyboard.
         She smiles at screen, types quickly."

      "Product in use"
      → "Close-up: fingers tap phone screen. App opens.
         User scrolls through feed. Thumb hovers, then taps
         'Buy Now'. Confirmation animation plays."

      DESCRIBE:
      - What the camera sees (not does)
      - Specific actions occurring
      - Colors, expressions, movements
      - Frame composition when it matters
      - Timing/pacing of actions

      FOR AI VIDEO GENERATION:
      Even more specificity needed.
      AI interprets literally.
      Ambiguity = wrong output.

      # Specific in = specific out
    symptoms:
      - \'"What did you mean by...?" questions\'
      - Production doesn't match vision
      - Multiple revision rounds
      - AI generates wrong content

  - id: feature-list-script
    summary: Script that's really a spoken feature list
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Script walks through product features one by one. "First, you can...
      Then, it also... Plus, there's..." The video is a verbal spec sheet.
    why: |
      Nobody watches feature lists. Features are information, not
      entertainment. Feature lists don't create emotional connection or
      memorability. They feel like homework.
    solution: |
      FEATURES → STORIES:

      INSTEAD OF FEATURE LIST:
      Show features solving problems.
      One problem, one solution, one emotion.

      TRANSFORMATION:
      Feature: "Real-time analytics"
      Story: Sarah stops guessing. Opens dashboard. Makes
             decision in seconds. Closes laptop. Makes dinner
             with her kids for the first time in weeks.

      STRUCTURE:
      - Lead with problem/desire
      - Show solution in action
      - Feature is tool, not star
      - End with transformed state

      IF YOU MUST COVER MULTIPLE FEATURES:
      - One feature per video (series)
      - Or: features as montage, 2-3 seconds each
      - Or: one hero feature, others hinted
      - Never a walkthrough

      THE EMOTION TEST:
      Does this script create any feeling?
      If just "informed," it's a feature list.

      # Features don't feel. Stories do.
    symptoms:
      - Script reads like documentation
      - No narrative arc
      - \'"And also" structure\'
      - Zero emotional engagement

  - id: no-clear-cta
    summary: Video ends without telling viewer what to do
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Video tells a great story, shows the product, then... fades to logo.
      No next step. No call to action. Viewer doesn't know what to do.
    why: |
      Video without CTA is missed opportunity. Viewer is engaged, interested,
      maybe ready to act—and you don't tell them how. Every video should
      move viewer toward something.
    solution: |
      CTA REQUIREMENTS:

      EVERY VIDEO NEEDS:
      - Clear next step
      - Specific action
      - Easy to remember/do
      - Appropriate to funnel stage

      CTA TYPES BY GOAL:
      Awareness: "Follow for more"
      Consideration: "Learn more at..."
      Conversion: "Start free trial"
      Retention: "Check out [feature]"

      CTA PLACEMENT:
      - End card (always)
      - Verbal CTA if VO exists
      - Text on screen
      - Multiple mentions for longer videos

      CTA FORMULA:
      [Action verb] + [Specific thing] + [Why now]
      "Start your free trial—no credit card needed"
      "Download the app—new users get 50% off this week"

      MAKE IT EASY:
      - Short URLs
      - QR codes for physical
      - \'"Link in bio" for social\'
      - Simple memorable next step

      # Don't waste the engagement you've earned
    symptoms:
      - Views don't convert
      - "Great video, now what?"
      - Engagement without action
      - Logo-only endings

  - id: duration-mismatch
    summary: Trying to fit too much story into too little time
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Script ambitious enough for 2-minute video crammed into 30 seconds.
      Everything is rushed. Nothing lands. Story is incomprehensible.
    why: |
      Time is the most limited resource in video. Trying to say too much
      results in saying nothing. Better to make one point well than three
      points poorly.
    solution: |
      CONTENT BY DURATION:

      6 SECONDS: One idea. Period.
      - Single hook
      - Single transformation
      - Tagline

      15 SECONDS: Setup + payoff
      - One problem
      - One solution
      - One emotion

      30 SECONDS: Mini story
      - Beginning, middle, end
      - One character
      - One journey

      60 SECONDS: Full story
      - Complete arc
      - Room to breathe
      - Emotional build

      IF SCRIPT WON'T FIT:
      - Cut ideas, not words
      - Choose ONE message
      - Make it longer
      - Split into series

      RULE: Your script needs 20% buffer.
      If it times to 30 seconds, target 25.

      # Less is more is law
    symptoms:
      - Reading script feels rushed
      - No moments to land
      - Cutting all breathing room
      - Story incomprehensible at speed

  - id: talking-head-default
    summary: Defaulting to person-talking-at-camera format
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Every video is someone talking to camera explaining things. No visual
      variety, no scene changes, no demonstration—just talking head.
    why: |
      Talking heads are boring. They're the default because they're easy,
      not because they're effective. Static shot of person talking has
      lowest engagement. Modern attention requires visual variety.
    solution: |
      ALTERNATIVES TO TALKING HEAD:

      VISUAL VARIETY:
      - B-roll over voiceover
      - Screen recordings with VO
      - Animated graphics
      - Product demos
      - Customer footage
      - Location variety
      - Mixed format

      IF TALKING HEAD NECESSARY:
      - Cut frequently (3-5 second shots)
      - Multiple angles
      - Overlay graphics
      - Insert B-roll
      - Text emphasis
      - Keep under 60 seconds

      BETTER STRUCTURES:
      - Voiceover + demonstration
      - Narrative story (actors)
      - Animation/motion graphics
      - Customer testimonial montage
      - Documentary style
      - Screen tutorial with face-in-corner

      THE TEST:
      Can this script work WITHOUT talking head?
      If yes, it probably should.

      # Talking head is last resort
    symptoms:
      - Every video same format
      - Viewer fatigue
      - Low watch time
      - \'"Boring" feedback\'

  - id: music-afterthought
    summary: Writing script without considering audio design
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Script complete. Production starts. "Oh, what music should we use?"
      Audio is cobbled together last minute without integration.
    why: |
      Audio is 50% of video. Music sets tone, pace, emotion. Sound design
      creates immersion. When audio is afterthought, it shows. Great videos
      are designed audio-visually from the start.
    solution: |
      AUDIO-INTEGRATED SCRIPTING:

      INCLUDE IN SCRIPT:
      [MUSIC: Upbeat, building, corporate]
      [SFX: Keyboard typing]
      [MUSIC: Swells at transformation moment]
      [VO: Character narration, warm tone]

      MUSIC PLANNING:
      - Temp track while writing
      - Know the emotional arc in sound
      - Plan beats to music beats
      - License music early

      AUDIO DESIGN ELEMENTS:
      - Music (scored or licensed)
      - Sound effects
      - Voiceover (style, tone)
      - Ambient sound
      - Silence (powerful when intentional)

      SCRIPT TIMING:
      - Read aloud with music
      - Feel the rhythm
      - Adjust pacing to audio
      - Build beats together

      # Audio isn't decoration—it's half the experience
    symptoms:
      - Music doesn't fit
      - Audio feels disconnected
      - Pacing issues
      - Last-minute scramble

  - id: platform-blind-scripting
    summary: Writing one script for all platforms
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Writing a single script expected to work on TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn,
      Instagram, and TV. No platform-specific adaptation.
    why: |
      Each platform has different requirements, audiences, and behaviors.
      TikTok vertical isn't YouTube horizontal. LinkedIn professional isn't
      TikTok casual. One script for all = optimized for none.
    solution: |
      PLATFORM-SPECIFIC SCRIPTS:

      CORE SCRIPT:
      - The story/message essence
      - Platform-agnostic version
      - Master narrative

      PLATFORM ADAPTATIONS:
      TikTok:
      - Vertical (9:16)
      - Hook in 1 sec
      - Native/raw feel
      - Trend-aware

      YouTube:
      - Horizontal (16:9)
      - Hook in 5 sec
      - Can be longer
      - Chapter structure

      LinkedIn:
      - Square or horizontal
      - Professional tone
      - Sound-off design
      - B2B appropriate

      Instagram:
      - Vertical for Reels
      - Polished aesthetic
      - Music-forward

      ADAPTATION PROCESS:
      1. Write core script
      2. Adapt hook for platform
      3. Adjust duration
      4. Modify tone
      5. Format for platform

      # Same story, different telling
    symptoms:
      - Awkward crops
      - Wrong tone for platform
      - Poor performance across board
      - Wasted production
