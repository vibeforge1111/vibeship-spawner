mcp_tools:
  # Claude for Script Development
  - name: script-writing
    description: AI-assisted script development
    install: Built into Claude Code
    capabilities:
      - script-drafting
      - format-conversion
      - hook-generation
      - duration-adaptation
    example_usage: |
      Use Claude for scriptwriting:
      - Draft scripts from brief
      - Generate hook variations
      - Adapt scripts for different durations
      - Convert between formats
      - Review for story structure

  # Script Timing
  - name: script-timing
    description: Calculate script read times
    config:
      notes: |
        Script timing guidelines:
        - Average speaking: 150 words/minute
        - Fast speaking: 170 words/minute
        - Slow/deliberate: 130 words/minute

        Quick calculation:
        6 sec = ~15 words
        15 sec = ~37 words
        30 sec = ~75 words
        60 sec = ~150 words

        Always add 10-20% buffer for pacing.

       3. 6-second version (single moment)

       Maintain core message. Don't just speed up—
       make strategic cuts."
