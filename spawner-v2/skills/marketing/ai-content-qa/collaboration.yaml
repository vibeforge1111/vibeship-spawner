# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Software QA
    insight: |
      Software QA teaches systematic testing:
      - Test plans before testing
      - Edge cases, not just happy paths
      - Regression testing (does fix break else?)
      - Automated where possible, human where necessary
      - Bug tracking and pattern analysis
      Content QA benefits from the same rigor.
    applies_when: "Building systematic QA processes"

  - domain: Aviation Safety
    insight: |
      Aviation invented checklists because:
      - Memory fails under pressure
      - Even experts forget basics
      - Redundancy catches errors
      - Standard processes = predictable quality
      Marketing content has lower stakes but same principles.
    applies_when: "Implementing QA checklists"

  - domain: Scientific Peer Review
    insight: |
      Academic peer review demonstrates:
      - Fresh eyes catch what authors miss
      - Verification improves credibility
      - Structured review beats casual reading
      - Feedback should improve, not attack
      - Claims need evidence
      Content review follows similar patterns.
    applies_when: "Reviewing factual claims and providing feedback"

  - domain: Film Post-Production
    insight: |
      Film editors know about feedback:
      - Multiple review passes for different issues
      - Color correction vs. story vs. sound
      - Lock picture before final audio
      - Objective timecodes for feedback
      Content review benefits from similar staging.
    applies_when: "Multi-pass content review"

  - domain: Legal Document Review
    insight: |
      Legal review teaches precision:
      - Every word can have consequences
      - Version control is critical
      - Approval chains exist for a reason
      - "Close enough" isn't good enough for claims
      Marketing claims have legal implications too.
    applies_when: "Reviewing content with claims or legal considerations"
