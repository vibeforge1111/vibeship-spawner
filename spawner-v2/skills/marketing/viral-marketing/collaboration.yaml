      VIRAL LOOP DESIGN:
      "Design a viral loop for [product/content].

       Current state:
       - User action: [what users do]
       - Value proposition: [why they share]

       Create:
       - Share trigger (what prompts sharing)
       - Share mechanism (how they share)
       - Receiver value (why recipient engages)
       - Conversion path (how receiver becomes user)
       - Loop closure (how new user shares)"

      SHARE TRIGGER ANALYSIS:
      "Analyze these share triggers for [content type]:

       Current share rate: [X%]
       Content examples: [list]

       Identify:
       - Emotional triggers present
       - Social currency elements
       - Practical value
       - Story/narrative elements
       - Missing viral elements"

      K-FACTOR OPTIMIZATION:
      "Optimize viral coefficient for [product].

       Current metrics:
       - Invites sent per user: [X]
       - Invite acceptance rate: [Y%]
       - Current k-factor: [Z]

       Recommend:
       - Ways to increase invites per user
       - Ways to improve acceptance rate
       - Expected impact on k-factor"

# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Epidemiology
    insight: |
      Epidemiologists understand spread:
      - R0 (reproduction number) = k-factor
      - Super-spreaders matter most
      - Network structure affects spread
      - Timing of intervention matters
      - Herd immunity = market saturation
      Viral marketing follows disease spread patterns.
    applies_when: "Designing viral loops and measuring spread"

  - domain: Network Science
    insight: |
      Network scientists know connectivity:
      - Weak ties spread information further
      - Clustering affects viral speed
      - Hub nodes accelerate spread
      - Bridge nodes cross communities
      - Network effects compound
      Social networks are the medium for virality.
    applies_when: "Identifying seeding strategy and influencers"

  - domain: Behavioral Psychology
    insight: |
      Psychologists know sharing motivation:
      - Social currency (makes me look good)
      - Triggers (top of mind)
      - Emotion (high arousal = sharing)
      - Public (visible = imitated)
      - Practical value (useful = shared)
      - Stories (narratives spread)
      STEPPS framework from Jonah Berger.
    applies_when: "Designing shareable content"

  - domain: Meme Culture
    insight: |
      Meme creators know remixability:
      - Templates invite participation
      - Inside jokes create tribes
      - Timing beats perfection
      - Absurdity cuts through
      - Evolution happens naturally
      Meme mechanics apply to all viral content.
