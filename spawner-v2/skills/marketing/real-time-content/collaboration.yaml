  notes: |
    Real-time tools change frequently.

    Key considerations:
    - Platform algorithm changes
    - Trend detection accuracy
    - AI generation speed improvements
    - New platform features
    - API rate limits and costs

    API Integration Best Practices:
    - Build retry logic for rate limits
    - Cache trend data to reduce API calls
    - Implement fallbacks when APIs are down
    - Monitor API costs (AI generation can get expensive)
    - Test workflows in staging before production

    Current as of December 2024.
