    summary: Publishing without sensitivity check in rush to be first
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Racing to publish trend content without considering whether the
      trend is connected to tragedy, controversy, or sensitive topics.
    why: |
      Speed kills (your brand). One insensitive post during a crisis can
      overshadow years of good marketing. Real-time doesn't mean
      thoughtless. Five minutes for sensitivity check is worth it.
    solution: |
      SENSITIVITY CHECKPOINT:

      BEFORE EVERY POST, ASK:
      1. What's happening in the news right now?
      2. Could this trend be connected to tragedy?
      3. Is there any way this could be insensitive?
      4. What's the worst interpretation?
      5. Are there affected communities?

      RED FLAG TOPICS:
      - Active violence/tragedy
      - Political controversies
      - Cultural appropriation concerns
      - Health crises
      - Natural disasters
      - Death of public figures

      IF ANY CONCERN:
      - Delay publication
      - Get second opinion
      - When in doubt, don't

      # 5 minutes now > crisis later
    symptoms:
      - Social media backlash
      - Brand apology needed
      - \'"Read the room" criticism\'

  - id: forced-brand-connection
    summary: Jumping on trends that don't naturally fit brand
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Forcing brand into trending conversations where there's no natural
      connection, making the brand look desperate or out of touch.
    why: |
      Audiences immediately sense forced connections. "What does [brand]
      have to do with this?" comments are death. Cringe is worse than
      silence. Not every trend is your trend.
    solution: |
      BRAND FIT CHECK:

      NATURAL FIT CRITERIA:
      1. Relevance: Does this connect to what we do?
      2. Audience: Will our audience care about this?
      3. Value: Can we add something unique?
      4. Authenticity: Does this feel like us?
      5. Permission: Do we have "standing" here?

      IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION:
      → It's forced. Skip it.

      GOOD FIT EXAMPLES:
      - Athletic brand + sports moment
      - Food brand + food trend
      - Tech brand + tech news
      - Any brand + genuinely universal moment

      BAD FIT EXAMPLES:
      - Insurance brand + meme trend
      - B2B software + pop culture moment
      - Any brand + tragedy "tribute"

      # Selective excellence > universal mediocrity
    symptoms:

    summary: Attempting real-time without pre-approved templates
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Trying to create and publish real-time content without pre-built
      systems for templates, approvals, and workflows.
    why: |
      Real-time without systems = chaos. Every post requires full creative
      process, legal review, stakeholder approval. By the time you're done,
      the moment passed. Systems enable speed.
    solution: |
      PRE-BUILD THESE:

      1. TEMPLATE LIBRARY:
         - Visual templates in brand style
         - Copy frameworks for common scenarios
         - Platform-specific formats ready
         - All pre-approved

      2. APPROVAL MATRIX:
         - What can go out without approval
         - What needs quick review
         - What needs full process
         - Who approves what

      3. ASSET LIBRARY:
         - Brand elements ready to use
         - Product imagery
         - Character/mascot variations
         - AI prompt templates

      4. WORKFLOW:
         - Clear roles (who does what)
         - Response timeframes
         - Escalation paths
         - Coverage for key moments

      BUILD BEFORE YOU NEED IT.

  - id: stale-real-time
    summary: Publishing hours or days after moment has passed
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Completing content creation after the trend has peaked, publishing
      when the moment is already stale.
    why: |
      Late real-time content is worse than no content. Shows you're trying
      to be relevant but failing. Screams "we're slow." Most trends peak
      in 2-6 hours; if you miss that window, skip it.
    solution: |
      TIMING RULES:

      HOT MOMENTS (2-6 hour window):
      - Viral memes
      - Breaking culture moments
      - Surprise news
      → If you can't publish within window, skip

      WARM MOMENTS (same day):
      - Planned events
      - Anticipated announcements
      - Award shows, sports events
      → Can take a bit longer if angle is unique

      COLD MOMENTS (1+ day):
      - Only if adding significant value
      - \'"Hot take" opportunity\'
      - Contrarian/different perspective
      → Usually better to skip

      DECISION FRAMEWORK:
      Before starting: "Will this still be relevant when we finish?"
      If no → Don't start
    symptoms:
      - \'"This is so yesterday" comments\'
      - Low engagement

  - id: every-trend-response
    summary: Feeling obligated to respond to every trending topic
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Treating every trend as an opportunity, exhausting team and
      diluting brand by responding to everything.
    why: |
      Most trend responses are mediocre. Better to do 1 great execution
      than 10 forgettable ones. Team burnout is real. Selective excellence
      builds reputation.
    solution: |
      SELECTION CRITERIA:

      MUST HAVE ALL:
      - Natural brand connection
      - Audience relevance
      - Time to execute well
      - Unique angle to add
      - No sensitivity concerns

      PRIORITIZATION:
      Tier 1: Perfect fit + high impact → Full effort
      Tier 2: Good fit + medium impact → Quick execution
      Tier 3: Marginal fit → Skip

      WEEKLY QUOTA:
      - Not every day needs trend content
      - 2-3 great executions/week > 10 mediocre
      - Quality builds reputation

      PERMISSION TO SKIP:
      "This isn't our moment" is a valid decision
    symptoms:
      - Team exhaustion
      - Declining quality
      - Forced content

  - id: copying-competitors
    summary: Replicating how competitors responded to trend
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Seeing competitor's trend response and copying the approach rather
      than finding unique angle.
    why: |
      Second-to-market with same idea = derivative. Audiences notice.
      Your brand should have unique perspective. If you can't add
      something different, you're just noise.
    solution: |
      FIND YOUR ANGLE:

      IF COMPETITOR WENT FIRST:
      1. Can we do opposite/contrarian?
      2. Can we add our unique perspective?
      3. Can we go deeper/longer-form?
      4. Can we address different audience?
      5. Is there uncovered angle?

      IF NO UNIQUE ANGLE:
      → Skip this one. Wait for next trend.

      YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR:
      - Brand voice (how you say it)
      - Brand expertise (what you know)
      - Brand assets (what you have)
      - Brand community (who you reach)

      Use your differentiators, not competitor's playbook.
    symptoms:
      - \'"They did what [competitor] did" comments\'
      - Lower engagement than competitor

  - id: meme-misuse
    summary: Using meme format incorrectly
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Using a meme format without understanding its origin, meaning, or
      correct usage, resulting in cringe.
    why: |
      Meme literacy matters. Using format wrong signals you don't
      understand internet culture. If you have to explain why it's funny,
      you've failed. Meme misuse is screenshot-worthy cringe.
    solution: |
      MEME USAGE CHECKLIST:

      BEFORE USING MEME:
      □ Research the origin
      □ Understand the format
      □ Check current usage
      □ Verify still relevant (not dead)
      □ Confirm appropriateness

      CORRECT USAGE:
      - Follow format structure exactly
      - Add brand twist, not format change
      - Timing matters (don't be late)
      - Self-awareness helps

      WHEN IN DOUBT:
      - Ask someone under 30
      - Check KnowYourMeme.com
      - Look at recent examples
      - If still unsure, skip

      # Meme misuse = internet cringe hall of fame

    summary: Publishing and walking away
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Publishing real-time content and not monitoring response, missing
      engagement opportunities or problems.
    why: |
      Real-time content creates real-time conversation. If you're not
      there to engage, you miss the value. Also: problems can emerge
      that need quick response.
    solution: |
      POST-PUBLISH MONITORING:

      FIRST HOUR:
      - Monitor comments actively
      - Respond to engagement
      - Watch for problems
      - Share internally if going well

      FIRST DAY:
      - Track performance metrics
      - Continue engagement
      - Flag any issues
      - Document learnings

      ENGAGEMENT RESPONSE:
      - Reply to comments quickly
      - Engage authentically
      - Don't over-brand responses
      - Know when to stop

      PROBLEM RESPONSE:
      - Watch for negative sentiment
      - Quick escalation if needed
      - Don't delete/hide unless serious
      - Learn for next time
    symptoms:
      - Missed engagement opportunities

    summary: Requiring full approval process for all real-time content
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Routing all real-time content through standard approval process,
      killing speed and missing moments.
    why: |
      Standard approval: 2-3 days. Trend window: 2-6 hours. The math
      doesn't work. Real-time requires pre-approved frameworks and
      expedited paths.
    solution: |
      TIERED APPROVAL:

      TIER 1: PRE-APPROVED (no approval needed)
      - Uses pre-approved templates
      - Within defined topic boundaries
      - No claims or commitments
      - Published by approved team members

      TIER 2: QUICK APPROVAL (30 min max)
      - Minor variations from template
      - New but safe topic
      - One approver required
      - Slack/message approval ok

      TIER 3: EXPEDITED (2 hours max)
      - New creative
      - Sensitive topic
      - Multiple approvers
      - Still faster than normal

      TIER 4: FULL PROCESS (skip real-time)
      - Legal claims
      - Controversy potential
      - Major commitments
      - Not appropriate for real-time

      PRE-DEFINE which content fits which tier.

    summary: Slow AI generation blocking real-time workflow
    severity: low
    situation: |
      AI image/video generation taking too long, causing missed timing
      windows for trend content.
    why: |
      AI generation can take minutes. Queue waits can add more. In
      real-time, minutes matter. Need strategies to work around
      generation delays.
    solution: |
      AI SPEED STRATEGIES:

      1. PARALLEL GENERATION:
         - Generate multiple options simultaneously
         - Don't wait for one to finish
         - Select best from batch

      2. TEMPLATE LIBRARY:
         - Pre-generated assets for common scenarios
         - Quick modification vs full generation
         - Fill-in-blank approach

      3. FASTEST MODELS:
         - Turbo/fast versions for real-time
         - Save quality models for planned content
         - Know your tool speeds

      4. HYBRID APPROACH:
         - AI-assist, human finish
         - Quick generation + manual refinement
         - Don't wait for perfect

      5. PLATFORM SELECTION:
         - Some platforms faster than others
         - Queue times vary
         - Have backup options

      # Speed over perfection for real-time
    symptoms:
