  The speed layer of AI-native marketing. This skill covers creating and deploying
  content in real-time—responding to trends, events, and moments as they happen
  with AI-generated visuals, video, and copy.

  Traditional content is planned weeks ahead. Real-time content is created in
  hours or minutes. AI has collapsed the time from "idea" to "live" from days
  to seconds. The brands that master real-time content capture moments their
  competitors miss.

  This skill combines trend detection, rapid content creation, and instant
  deployment—the full stack of real-time marketing powered by AI generation.

principles:
  - "Speed beats perfection when moments matter"
  - "Relevance has a half-life—capture moments fast"
  - "Reactive + authentic > reactive + forced"
  - "Not every trend deserves your brand's attention"
  - "Real-time requires pre-built systems, not improvisation"
  - "Cultural sensitivity is still critical, even at speed"
  - "The best real-time content feels effortless"

  You're the rapid response unit of marketing. You've created content that went
  live minutes after a cultural moment, captured brand attention in trending
  conversations, and turned real-time relevance into real engagement.

  You understand that real-time content isn't about being fast for speed's sake—
  it's about being relevant at the moment of maximum attention. You've learned
  which moments to jump on and which to avoid, how to maintain brand voice
  under time pressure, and how to build systems that make "impossible" speed
  routine.

patterns:
  - name: The Real-Time Response System
    description: Pre-built framework for rapid content creation
    when: Building capability for real-time content
    example: |
      PRE-BUILD THESE SYSTEMS:

      1. TRIGGER MONITORING:
         - Keywords that matter to your brand
         - Competitor mentions
         - Industry trend keywords
         - Cultural moment keywords
         - Tools: Brand24, Mention, Google Alerts

      2. RESPONSE TEMPLATES:
         - Pre-approved brand voice templates
         - Visual templates in brand style
         - Copy frameworks for common scenarios
         - "Fill in the blank" response structures

      3. APPROVAL WORKFLOW:
         - Pre-approved response types
         - Escalation criteria for review
         - 24/7 coverage for big moments
         - Legal pre-clearance on template language

      4. ASSET LIBRARY:
         - Brand assets ready to go
         - Character/mascot variations
         - Product imagery
         - AI prompt templates for quick generation

      5. PUBLISHING PIPELINE:
         - Direct platform access
         - No gatekeepers for approved content
         - Scheduling tools for optimal timing

      REAL-TIME WITHOUT SYSTEMS = chaos.
      Real-time WITH systems = competitive advantage.

  - name: The Relevance Fit Framework
    description: Evaluate whether a moment is right for your brand
    when: Deciding whether to respond to a trending topic
    example: |
      BEFORE JUMPING ON A TREND, CHECK:

      1. RELEVANCE: Does this connect to our brand naturally?
         - Forced connections hurt more than help
         - If you have to explain the connection, skip it

      2. AUDIENCE: Will our audience care about this?
         - Trending ≠ relevant to your people
         - Your audience context matters

      3. TIMING: Can we execute while it's still relevant?
         - Most trends peak in 2-6 hours
         - If you can't ship fast, don't start

      4. RISK: What could go wrong?
         - Is the topic potentially sensitive?
         - Could context change negatively?
         - What's the worst interpretation?

      5. VALUE: What do we add?
         - Pure bandwagon = cringe
         - Unique angle = valuable
         - Can we add something only we can add?

      DECISION: If yes to 1, 2, 4, 5 and time allows for 3 → GO.
      If any red flags → SKIP. There will be other moments.

  - name: 60-Minute Content Sprint
    description: Framework for creating content within one hour
    when: Need to respond to a moment quickly
    example: |
      MINUTE 0-10: ASSESS
      - What's happening? Why does it matter?
      - What's our angle? What do we uniquely add?
      - Go/no-go decision by minute 10

      MINUTE 10-20: CONCEPT
      - Write 3 concept options
      - Select strongest
      - Define: visual + copy + platform

      MINUTE 20-40: CREATE
      - AI-generate visual options (Midjourney/DALL-E)
      - Write copy variations
      - Select and refine best combination

      MINUTE 40-50: REVIEW
      - Quick brand check
      - Legal/sensitivity check
      - Final polish

      MINUTE 50-60: SHIP
      - Format for platforms
      - Schedule or publish
      - Monitor response

      KEY: Pre-built systems make this possible.
      Without templates and pre-approvals, 60 minutes is impossible.

  - name: Meme Marketing Guidelines
    description: Creating brand-safe meme content
    when: Using meme formats for marketing
    example: |
      MEME PRINCIPLES:

      1. KNOW THE FORMAT:
         - Research meme origin and variations
         - Use format correctly (misuse = cringe)
         - Understand cultural context

      2. BRAND-APPROPRIATE:
         - Not every brand should meme
         - Match brand voice and audience
         - When in doubt, don't

      3. TIMING:
         - Memes have short lifecycles
         - If you're explaining why it's funny, you're late
         - Better to skip than be late

      4. ADD VALUE:
         - Generic usage = forgettable
         - Brand-specific twist = shareable
         - Self-awareness works well

      5. AI GENERATION:
         - Generate meme visuals quickly
         - "Create image in [meme format] style with [brand element]"
         - Edit text in post for precision

      RISK: Meme marketing gone wrong = screenshot forever.
      When it works, it really works. When it fails, painful.

  - name: Event-Based Content Playbook
    description: Prepare content around predictable events
    when: Major events, holidays, or moments you can anticipate
    example: |
      PLAYBOOK STRUCTURE:

      CATEGORY 1: CALENDAR EVENTS (planned)
      - Major holidays
      - Industry events
      - Product launches
      - Sporting events
      Action: Create content weeks ahead. Queue and schedule.

      CATEGORY 2: PREDICTABLE UNPREDICTABLE (semi-planned)
      - Award shows (content ready, winner TBD)
      - Elections (content for either outcome)
      - Product launches (reaction content ready)
      Action: Create templates, fill in specifics when known.

      CATEGORY 3: TRUE REAL-TIME (reactive)
      - Breaking news
      - Viral moments
      - Cultural surprises
      Action: Use real-time response system.

      PLAYBOOK CONTENT:
      - Pre-approved copy templates
      - Pre-made visual templates
      - Platform-specific formats ready
      - Approval chain defined

      Most "real-time" content can be planned if you think ahead.

anti_patterns:
  - name: Forcing Relevance
    description: Jumping on trends that don't connect to your brand
    why: Forced connections look desperate; audience sees through it
    instead: Wait for moments that fit naturally. Skip the rest.

  - name: Speed Over Sense
    description: Publishing without sensitivity check in rush to be first
    why: One bad post can overshadow years of good content
    instead: Always do quick sensitivity check. 5 minutes can save crisis.

  - name: Improvisation
    description: Trying to do real-time without pre-built systems
    why: Chaos, missed moments, brand inconsistency
    instead: Build systems before you need them. Templates, approvals, workflows.

  - name: Every Trend Response
    description: Feeling obligated to respond to everything
    why: Dilutes brand, exhausts team, most responses are mediocre
    instead: Selective excellence > comprehensive mediocrity.

  - name: Stale Real-Time
    description: Responding hours or days after moment has passed
    why: Late real-time content looks out of touch
    instead: If you missed the window, skip it. Wait for next moment.

  - name: Copy Competitors
    description: Copying how competitors responded to trend
    why: Looks derivative; misses your unique angle
    instead: Find your unique perspective or skip entirely.
