    summary: Publishing content that no one finds or reads
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Let's publish 4 blog posts per week!"
      Result: 200 blog posts, 50 monthly visitors, 0 leads, 0 revenue.
    why: |
      Time and money wasted on invisible content. No SEO (not what people search),
      not shareable, no distribution plan, no clear CTA.
    solution: |
      # Before writing anything:
      - Who is this for specifically?
      - What are they searching?
      - What exists already?
      - How will we beat it?
      - Where will we distribute it?
      - What action do we want?

      # Better approach:
      4 excellent posts per month > 16 mediocre posts
      Each post: researched, optimized, promoted

      # Example:
      Instead of: "10 Marketing Tips" (generic)
      Create: "How SaaS Companies Reduce Churn by 40%: Data from 500 Companies" (specific, data-driven)
    symptoms:
      - High volume, low traffic
      - No organic search growth
      - Can't attribute leads to content
      - Writers burning out on invisible work
    detection_pattern:
      context:
        - "blog strategy"
        - "content calendar"
        - "publishing schedule"
      intent:

  - id: keyword-first-trap
    summary: Writing for search engines, forgetting about humans
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "This keyword has 10K monthly searches!"
      Content stuffed with keywords, unreadable by humans.
      Reader closes tab. Google ranks competitor higher.
    why: |
      Google measures user satisfaction: time on page, bounce rate, scroll depth.
      Keyword-stuffed content = bad metrics = lower rankings.
      You need to satisfy users to satisfy Google.
    solution: |
      1. Research keyword intent
         What do they actually want to learn?

      2. Write for the reader first
         Solve their problem thoroughly

      3. Naturally include keywords
         In title, headings, intro
         But not forced or repeated

      4. Add unique value
         Original insights, data, examples
         What can only you provide?

      # Process:
      Keyword research → Understand intent →
      Create best resource → Optimize naturally →
      Measure user engagement

      # Example:
      Keyword: "email marketing tips"
      Intent: They want actionable tactics, not generic advice
      Solution: Write "7 Email Subject Line Formulas That Increased Our Open Rate by 127%" with real data and templates
    symptoms:
      - Rankings drop despite keyword focus
      - High bounce rates
      - Low time on page
      - Content reads awkwardly

    severity: high
    situation: |
      Blog topics: "Our CEO's vision" "Company culture" "Office tour"
      "Employee spotlight" "Anniversary celebration"
      Traffic: 47 visits (all internal).
    why: |
      No one cares about you until you help them first.
      Your audience cares about their problems, goals, and learning—not your news.
    solution: |
      # Content that works:
      Problem-focused:
      "How to solve [problem they have]"

      Educational:
      "The complete guide to [topic they care about]"

      Tactical:
      "5 ways to [achieve outcome they want]"

      # Me-first content rules:
      OK: Customer stories (their success, not your product)
      OK: Product updates (if saves them time/money)
      AVOID: Company news (save for press releases)
      AVOID: Internal celebrations (save for LinkedIn)

      # Example transformation:
      Instead of: "We raised Series A!"
      Create: "How We Scaled From 0 to 100K Users: Lessons for Early-Stage Startups"
    symptoms:
      - Low external traffic

    summary: Publishing content once and never touching it again
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Published: "Best Tools for [X] in 2020"
      Still live in 2024. Rankings dropped. Information outdated.
      User experience: bad. Brand perception: neglected.
    why: |
      Content decays. Information outdates, links break, competitors publish better,
      keyword trends shift. Old content can hurt more than help.
    solution: |
      # Content lifecycle:
      New → Growing → Peak → Declining → Dead

      # Content maintenance:
      1. Quarterly audit
         Which content performs?
         Which is outdated?
         Which should be pruned?

      2. Update winners
         Refresh statistics
         Add new sections
         Improve SEO

      3. Consolidate related content
         Merge thin articles
         Create comprehensive guides

      4. Prune dead content
         Remove or noindex
         Redirect if has links

      # Maintenance schedule:
      Top 20%: Update quarterly
      Middle 60%: Review annually
      Bottom 20%: Prune or consolidate

      # Example:
      "Email Marketing Guide 2020" → "Email Marketing Guide 2024"
      - Updated tools and strategies
      - Added new sections on AI and automation
      - Refreshed all screenshots
      - Result: Rankings recovered, traffic +400%
    symptoms:
      - Outdated dates in content

    summary: Writing about everything, owning nothing
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Blog topics: marketing automation, home office design, productivity tips,
      recipes, travel, tech reviews. Authority in nothing.
    why: |
      Impossible to build topical authority. SEO rewards deep coverage of a topic,
      internal linking between related content, expertise signals.
    solution: |
      1. Define 3-5 content pillars
         Core topics you own
         Aligned with product and audience

      2. Go deep, not wide
         Comprehensive coverage
         All angles of each pillar

      3. Build topic clusters
         Pillar page: Comprehensive overview
         Cluster pages: Specific subtopics
         Internal links: Connect them all

      # Example:
      Pillar: "Email Marketing"
      ├── Email list building
      ├── Email automation
      ├── Email copywriting
      ├── Email deliverability
      └── Email analytics

      Each pillar: 10-20 cluster articles, interlinked

      # Example transformation:
      BEFORE: Writing about marketing, sales, productivity, tech, lifestyle
      AFTER: Deep focus on SaaS marketing (SEO, content, email, paid ads, analytics)
      Result: Become THE resource for SaaS marketing
    symptoms:
      - No topical authority
      - Scattered traffic
      - Confused audience
      - Rankings across nothing

    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Spend 20 hours creating content. Click publish. Tweet once.
      Wonder why no traffic.
    why: |
      Great content no one sees is worthless.
      Creation:Distribution should be 1:1.
      20 hours creating = 20 hours promoting.
    solution: |
      # Distribution channels:
      Owned: Email list, website, social profiles
      Earned: SEO, social shares, press, guest posts
      Paid: Social ads, content ads, sponsored

      # Distribution playbook (copy-paste ready):
      Day 0: Publish + email list
      Day 1: Social posts (all platforms)
      Day 2: Employee amplification
      Day 3: Community sharing (Reddit, forums)
      Day 7: LinkedIn article version
      Day 14: Twitter thread version
      Day 30: Update and reshare
      Month 3: Refresh and republish

      # Repurposing:
      Blog post → Twitter thread (10 tweets)
      Blog post → LinkedIn carousel (8 slides)
      Blog post → YouTube video (10 min)
      Blog post → Email series (5 emails)
      Blog post → Podcast episode
      Blog post → Infographic

      # Real example:
      Blog post: "SaaS Pricing Strategies" (20 hours)
      Distribution: Twitter thread (2 hours), LinkedIn carousel (3 hours), Email newsletter (1 hour), Reddit posts (1 hour)
      Result: 5x traffic vs publish-only approach
    symptoms:
      - Publish and forget
      - No distribution plan
      - Great content, no traffic

    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Let's write about AI and the future of work"
      "Thought piece on digital transformation"
      Too broad to rank. Too vague to help.
    why: |
      Vanity topics are too broad, too vague, too obvious, too generic.
      High competition, low intent. No differentiation.
    solution: |
      # Instead of broad, go specific:
      "AI in Marketing" → "How to use ChatGPT for email subject lines"
      "Digital Transformation" → "How to migrate from Salesforce to HubSpot"
      "The Future of Work" → "How to run productive async standups"

      # Topic validation checklist:
      1. Search volume exists
      2. You can rank (competition)
      3. It relates to your product
      4. It serves a clear audience
      5. There's a clear action after reading

      Broad = high competition, low intent
      Specific = achievable rankings, high intent

      # Example:
      VANITY: "The Future of Content Marketing"
      SPECIFIC: "How to Build a Content Calendar That Actually Gets Followed: Template + Process"
      Result: Specific ranks, gets traffic, converts
    symptoms:
      - Can't rank for topics

      "7 Tips for Better..."
      Every piece is a list.
    why: |
      Overused format, limited depth, low differentiation.
      Listicles are easy but often thin and commoditized.
    solution: |
      # Content format variety:
      1. How-to guides (step-by-step)
      2. Ultimate guides (comprehensive)
      3. Case studies (proof and story)
      4. Original research (unique data)

      7. Templates (immediate value)
      8. Tools/calculators (utility)
      9. Framework posts (mental models)

      # Listicle rules:
      OK: Use when truly the best format
      NOT OK: Don't default to lists

      New blog post: Published!
      Links pointing to it: 0
      Links going from it: 1 (to homepage)
      Connected to content strategy: No
    why: |
      Loses SEO value, users can't discover it. Internal linking distributes
      page authority, helps discovery, signals topic relationships to Google.
    solution: |
      # Every new piece of content:
      1. Links TO 3-5 related articles
      2. Gets links FROM 3-5 related articles
      3. Links to relevant product pages
      4. Connected to pillar/cluster structure

      # Internal linking audit:
      - Find pages with few internal links
      - Find opportunities in existing content
      - Build linking into creation process
      - Update old content with new links

      # Content connections:
      Pillar page ↔ Cluster pages
      Related topics ↔ Each other
      Content ↔ Product pages

      # Tool:
      Screaming Frog: Find orphan pages
      Ahrefs: Internal link opportunities
      Manual: Link budget for each new post

      # Example:

      Add links FROM: Update "Email Marketing Guide", "Marketing Automation", "Lead Nurturing"

      No measurement, no improvement.
    why: |
      Without measurement: keep making same mistakes, can't justify investment,
      no learning or optimization, decisions based on opinion.
    solution: |
      # Content metrics:
      Traffic: Page views, visitors, traffic source
      Engagement: Time on page, scroll depth, bounce rate
      SEO: Rankings, organic growth, backlinks
      Business: Conversions, revenue, signups

      # Measurement dashboard (copy-paste):
      Weekly: Top 10 posts by traffic
      Monthly: Traffic trends, new vs returning
      Quarterly: Content ROI, conversion paths
      Annually: Strategy effectiveness

      # Tools:
      Google Analytics 4: Traffic and engagement
      Google Search Console: Rankings and clicks
      Hotjar: User behavior
      Attribution tool: Revenue impact

      # Example:
      Discovered: "How-to" guides convert 3x better than "best of" lists
      Action: Shift content mix to 70% how-to, 30% other

      Every blog post: Introduction with hook, "In this article...",
      5 subheadings, image every 300 words, conclusion with CTA.
      Predictable, formulaic.
    why: |
      Template content blends with everything else. Feels formulaic to readers.
      Optimized for completion, not quality. Misses creative opportunities.
    solution: |
      # Breaking the template:
      - Lead with the takeaway (TL;DR first)
      - Use only one powerful example
      - Tell a story throughout
      - Make it interactive (quiz, calculator)
      - Create a tool instead of an article

      # Format variety:
      Week 1: Long-form guide (3000 words)
      Week 2: Quick tactical tip (500 words)
      Week 3: Case study (story format)
      Week 4: Comparison/review (table format)
      Week 5: Original research (data viz)

      # Balance:
      Structure good for: consistency, efficiency, SEO
      Flexibility good for: standing out, engagement, personality

      # Example:
      Standard template: "10 Email Marketing Tips" (800 words, predictable)
      Creative approach: Interactive email subject line generator with real-time A/B test predictions
      Result: 10x more shares, 5x more backlinks

      Publishing bad content to stay on schedule.
    why: |
      Calendar should provide visibility, not force mediocre content.
      Quality sacrificed for schedule. Burnout from constant deadlines.
    solution: |
      1. Buffer time
         Plan 2-3 weeks ahead
         Room for delays and iteration

      2. Quality gates
         Content isn't ready until it's ready
         Slip the date, not the quality

      3. Flexible formats
         If post isn't ready, run curated content
         If schedule is tight, go shorter

      4. Strategic scheduling
         Big pieces: When ready
         Regular content: Predictable schedule
         Reactive: As needed

      # Calendar rules:
      Calendar serves strategy, not vice versa
      Never publish mediocre to hit a date

      # Example:
      Instead of: "Must publish every Tuesday, no matter what"
      Try: "Major guides when ready (1-2/month), quick tips weekly (500 words), curated roundups as filler"
      Result: Better quality, less burnout, more flexibility

    summary: Optimizing for search engines at expense of reader value
    severity: high

      1. Create genuinely useful content
