# Copywriting Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that kill conversions and alienate readers

sharp_edges:
  - id: feature-dump
    summary: Listing features instead of explaining benefits
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Our product has: 256-bit encryption, real-time sync, API access..."
      Reader: "So what? Why should I care?"
    why: |
      Features are what you built. Benefits are what they get.
      Users buy outcomes, not specifications. Nobody cares about your tech stack.
    solution: |
      # Feature → Benefit translation:
      Feature: 256-bit encryption
      Benefit: Your data is safer than Fort Knox

      Feature: Real-time sync
      Benefit: Pick up exactly where you left off, on any device

      Feature: 99.9% uptime
      Benefit: It's there when you need it. Always.

      # The "So what?" test:
      For every feature, ask: "So what?"
      Keep asking until you hit the benefit.

      API access → "So what?"
      → Build integrations → "So what?"
      → Your tools work together seamlessly

      # Benefit structure:
      [Benefit headline]
      [Feature that enables it]
      [How their life is better]
    symptoms:
      - Spec sheets instead of sales pages
      - Technical jargon everywhere
      - Users ask "but what does it do for me?"
      - Low conversion despite great features

  - id: wall-of-text
    summary: Dense paragraphs that no one reads
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Our comprehensive project management solution offers a wide range of
      features designed to help teams of all sizes collaborate more effectively..."
      Nobody reads that.
    why: |
      Average attention span: seconds. Web reading: 20-28% of words.
      Long paragraphs: skipped entirely. People scan, they don't read.
    solution: |
      1. One idea per paragraph
         Break after every thought.

      2. Maximum 3-4 lines per paragraph
         On mobile, that's 2 sentences max.

      3. Use structure
         Headlines break up content
         Bullets make lists scannable
         Bold highlights key phrases

      4. The F-pattern
         Top line: Most important
         Left side: Key words

      5. Inverted pyramid
         Lead with the conclusion
         Details come after
    symptoms:
      - Low time on page
      - High scroll abandonment
      - Users skim to CTA
      - \'"TL;DR" comments\'

    summary: Prioritizing cleverness over clarity
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Synergize your workflow symphony"
      "Where data dances with destiny"
      Writer thinks: "That's creative!"
      Reader thinks: "What does this even mean?"
    why: |
      Clever copy makes the writer feel smart.
      Clear copy makes the reader feel smart.
      Confused readers don't convert.
    solution: |
      1. Say what you mean
         Clever: "Orchestrate your operational opus"
         Clear: "Get your team on the same page"

      2. The mom test
         Would your mom understand this?
         If not, simplify.

      3. The 5-second test
         Show someone for 5 seconds
         They should understand the offering

      # Clarity hierarchy:
      1. Crystal clear
      2. Clear and interesting
      3. Never just clever

      # Good clear copy:
      Slack: "Where work happens"
      Stripe: "Payments infrastructure for the internet"
      Mailchimp: "Send better email"
    symptoms:
      - Users confused about what you do
      - Low 5-second test scores
      - \'"Sounds cool but..." feedback\'
      - High bounce rate on landing pages

  - id: me-monster
    summary: Copy that talks about the company instead of the customer
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We are the leading provider of..."
      "Our company was founded in..."
      "We're passionate about..."
      Every sentence starts with us.
    why: |
      Nobody cares about you. They care about themselves.
      Readers ask: "What's in it for me?" not "What's your company story?"
    solution: |
      1. The you/we ratio
         Count "you" vs "we/our"
         You should appear 2-3x more

      2. Flip the perspective
         We: "We built the fastest..."
         You: "You'll never wait for..."

      3. Start with them
         Not: "We help teams collaborate"
         But: "Your team can finally stop searching through emails"

      # Perspective shift examples:
      We: "We offer 24/7 support"
      You: "Get help whenever you need it"

      We: "We've helped 10,000 customers"
      You: "Join 10,000 teams who work smarter"
    symptoms:
      - Every sentence starts with we/our
      - About page content on homepage
      - Self-congratulatory tone
      - Users don't see themselves in copy

  - id: jargon-jungle
    summary: Using industry jargon readers don't understand
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Our AI-powered SaaS solution leverages machine learning to optimize
      your KPIs through automated workflows and robust API integrations."
      Technical reader: "What does it actually do?"
      Everyone else: Leaves.
    why: |
      Jargon is a crutch. It signals insider status to insiders.
      It excludes everyone else. Confusion creates friction.
    solution: |
      # Plain language alternatives:
      Leverage → Use
      Robust → Strong
      Innovative → New
      Seamless → Easy
      Best-in-class → [Delete this]
      Synergy → [Delete this too]

      # The explain-to-a-friend test:
      Say it out loud to a friend.
      If you use different words, use those.

      # Jargon decoder:
      "Seamless integration" → "Works with your tools"
      "End-to-end solution" → "Everything you need"
      "Scalable platform" → "Grows with you"
      "Leverage" → "Use"
    symptoms:
      - Non-technical buyers bounce
      - Sales has to "translate"
      - Different copy for different audiences
      - Sounds like everyone else

  - id: vague-value-prop
    summary: Generic claims that could apply to anyone
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We help businesses grow"
      "The best solution for teams"
      "Making work easier"
      Could be any company. Therefore, it's no company.
    why: |
      Generic value props blend into the noise.
      Specific value props stand out.
      Specificity builds credibility.
    solution: |
      1. Get specific
         Generic: "Grow your business"
         Specific: "Get 30% more leads from your existing traffic"

      2. Name the pain
         Generic: "Better project management"
         Specific: "Stop losing tasks in email"

      3. Quantify when possible
         "Faster" → "3x faster"
         "Save money" → "Save $500/month"

      4. Own a word
         Volvo: Safety
         Apple: Simplicity
         What's yours?

      # Value prop template:
      For [specific audience] who [specific problem],
      [Product] is the [category] that [specific benefit].
    symptoms:
      - Interchangeable with competitors
      - No memorable positioning
      - "We do a lot of things"
      - Weak differentiation

  - id: weak-cta
    summary: Calls-to-action that don't compel action
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Submit" "Click here" "Learn more"
      Generic, boring, no urgency. CTA is where conversion happens.
    why: |
      CTAs are where conversion happens.
      Weak CTA = weak conversion.
      CTA should tell them what they get.
    solution: |
      1. Value-driven CTAs
         Not: "Submit"
         But: "Get my free guide"

         Not: "Learn more"
         But: "See how it works"

      2. First person works
         "Start my trial" > "Start your trial"

      3. Reduce friction in CTA
         "Buy now" → High commitment
         "See pricing" → Lower commitment
         "Get started free" → Even lower

      4. Action + benefit
         Action: "Download"
         Action + benefit: "Download the playbook"

      # CTA hierarchy (by commitment):
      Low: Learn more / See how it works
      Medium: Try it free / Start free trial
      High: Buy now / Add to cart
    symptoms:
      - Low click-through rates
      - Users unsure what happens next
      - Generic button text everywhere
      - No A/B testing on CTAs
    detection_pattern: '>Submit<|>Click here<|>Learn more<'

  - id: missing-specifics
    summary: Abstract claims without concrete proof
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Trusted by thousands" "Saves you time" "Better results"
      None of this is believable because none of it is specific.
    why: |
      Specifics are believable. Generalities are ignored.
      "Thousands" sounds made up. "10,847 teams" sounds real.
    solution: |
      1. Use real numbers
         Not: "Saves time"
         But: "Saves 4.5 hours per week"

      2. Name names
         Not: "Trusted by leading companies"
         But: "Trusted by Stripe, Shopify, and Notion"

      3. Specific outcomes
         Not: "Better results"
         But: "23% higher conversion rate"

      4. Concrete examples
         Not: "Flexible"
         But: "Works with Slack, Notion, Asana, and 100+ tools"

      # Specificity example:
      Vague: "High uptime"
      Specific: "99.99% uptime. That's 4 minutes of downtime per month."
    symptoms:
      - Claims without proof
      - Round numbers everywhere
      - No case studies or data
      - \'"Take our word for it" vibe\'

  - id: one-size-fits-all
    summary: Same copy for every audience and stage
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Landing page = Homepage copy
      Email = Landing page copy
      One piece of copy pasted everywhere.
    why: |
      Different people need different messages.
      Awareness stage needs problem recognition.
      Decision stage needs proof and action.
    solution: |
      # Match copy to stage:
      AWARENESS:
      "Struggling with [problem]?"
      Focus: Problem recognition

      CONSIDERATION:
      "Here's how we solve [problem]"
      Focus: Solution education

      DECISION:
      "Start your free trial today"
      Focus: Action and proof

      # Match copy to channel:
      AD: Hook + promise (few words)
      LANDING PAGE: Full value prop + proof
      EMAIL: Personal, conversational
      PRODUCT: Clear, helpful, brief
    symptoms:
      - Same message everywhere
      - Low conversion across stages
      - Generic rather than targeted

  - id: passive-voice-trap
    summary: Passive construction that weakens copy
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      "Your project will be completed faster"
      "Tasks are organized automatically"
      Who's doing what? Unclear. Energy? None.
    why: |
      Active voice is direct and powerful.
      Passive voice hides the actor and bores readers.
    solution: |
      1. Find the actor
         Passive: "Reports are generated automatically"
         Active: "Generate reports automatically"

      2. Use action verbs
         Passive: "Your data is protected"
         Active: "We protect your data"
         Better: "You control your data"

      3. Lead with action
         Passive: "Results can be seen in the dashboard"
         Active: "See results in your dashboard"

      # "By" is a warning sign
      "Emails are sent by the system"
      → "The system sends emails"
      → "Send emails automatically"
    symptoms:
      - Weak, indirect sentences
      - Unclear who does what
      - Low energy copy
      - \'"By" appears frequently\'

    summary: Cramming too much copy into limited space
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Hero section with: long headline, longer subheadline,
      three paragraphs, four bullets, two CTAs, trust badges,
      video, form. Nobody can process this.
    why: |
      White space is not wasted space. It focuses attention.
      Cluttered = overwhelming. Readers skip cluttered sections.
    solution: |
      1. One message per section
         Hero: Main value prop only
         Features: Benefits only
         Proof: Testimonials only

      2. Prioritize ruthlessly
         What's the ONE thing they need to know?
         Say that. Cut the rest.

      3. Progressive disclosure
         Surface level: Key message
         Deeper: More detail (if they want)

      4. Let copy breathe
         Short paragraphs
         Plenty of margin
         Strategic whitespace
    symptoms:
      - Overwhelming first impression
      - Users scroll past without reading
      - Important messages buried

      "Something went wrong"
      User is frustrated. This makes it worse.
    why: |
      Errors happen at vulnerable moments. Users are already frustrated.
      Your error message can help or hurt. Bad copy makes it worse.
    solution: |
      1. Be human
         Not: "Error 404"
         But: "Hmm, we couldn't find that page."

      2. Explain what happened
         Not: "Invalid input"
         But: "That email doesn't look right.
               Make sure it has an @ symbol."

      3. Tell them what to do
         Not: "Form submission failed"
         But: "Try again, or contact us at help@..."

      4. Take responsibility
         Not: "You entered wrong data"
         But: "Something went wrong on our end"
