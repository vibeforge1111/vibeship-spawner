# Patterns: Copywriting

Proven frameworks for writing copy that connects and converts.

---

## Pattern 1: The PAS Framework

**Context:** Structuring persuasive copy that moves readers to action.

**The Pattern:**
```
PAS = Problem → Agitation → Solution

PROBLEM:
Identify and name the pain.
Make them nod: "Yes, that's me."

AGITATION:
Twist the knife.
What happens if they don't solve this?
Make the problem feel urgent.

SOLUTION:
Your product as the answer.
Relief from the pain.
Clear path forward.

EXAMPLE:

P: "Tired of losing track of customer emails?"

A: "Every missed message is a missed opportunity.
    A frustrated customer. A lost sale.
    While you're searching through your inbox,
    your competitors are closing deals."

S: "HelpDesk puts every conversation in one place.
    Never miss another message.
    Never lose another customer."

PAS VARIATIONS:

PAS-CTA (add call to action):
Problem → Agitation → Solution → CTA

PASO (add outcome):
Problem → Agitation → Solution → Outcome

PASA (double agitation):
Problem → Agitation → Solution → More Agitation → Action

WHEN TO USE:
- Landing pages
- Email campaigns
- Ads
- Sales pages
- Product descriptions

PAS is the workhorse of persuasive copy.
Simple. Effective. Timeless.
```

## Pattern 2: The AIDA Framework

**Context:** Walking readers through the persuasion journey.

**The Pattern:**
```
AIDA = Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

ATTENTION:
Stop the scroll.
Bold claim. Surprising fact. Provocative question.
You have 2 seconds.

INTEREST:
Keep them reading.
Expand on the hook.
Make it relevant to them.

DESIRE:
Make them want it.
Benefits. Social proof. Vision of success.
Emotional connection.

ACTION:
Tell them what to do.
Clear CTA.
Remove friction.

EXAMPLE:

A: "What if you could write emails in half the time?"

I: "Most professionals spend 2+ hours a day on email.
    That's over 500 hours a year—just typing."

D: "EmailPro uses AI to draft responses that sound
    like you. Customers love it (4.9 stars).
    Teams report saving 10 hours per week."

A: "Try it free for 14 days. No credit card needed."

AIDA BY SECTION:

HEADLINE: Attention
SUBHEADLINE: Interest
BODY: Desire (benefits, proof)
CTA: Action

PAGE STRUCTURE:
Hero: A + I
Features: D
Social proof: D
Final: A

AIDA FOR ADS:
2-3 lines must hit all four.
Every word counts.
```

## Pattern 3: The BAB Framework

**Context:** Transformation-focused copy that shows the change.

**The Pattern:**
```
BAB = Before → After → Bridge

BEFORE:
Life before your solution.
The pain, frustration, struggle.
This is where they are now.

AFTER:
Life after your solution.
The relief, success, outcome.
This is where they could be.

BRIDGE:
How they get from Before to After.
Your product is the bridge.
Make the path clear.

EXAMPLE:

BEFORE:
"You're spending hours in spreadsheets,
manually tracking every transaction.
Errors slip through. You're always behind."

AFTER:
"Imagine reconciling in minutes, not hours.
Every transaction automatically matched.
Your books always up to date."

BRIDGE:
"AutoBooks connects to your accounts and
does the work for you. Import. Match. Done.
Start your free trial today."

BAB STRUCTURE:

Before: Paint the pain (specific)
After: Paint the dream (specific)
Bridge: Your solution (simple)

BAB VS PAS:
PAS: Problem → Twist → Solution
BAB: Current state → Future state → Path

BAB is gentler—less agitation, more inspiration.

WHEN TO USE BAB:
- Aspirational products
- When audience is solution-aware
- Brand-building copy
- Testimonial frameworks
```

## Pattern 4: The 4 Cs Framework

**Context:** Ensuring copy meets essential quality criteria.

**The Pattern:**
```
4 Cs = Clear → Concise → Compelling → Credible

CLEAR:
Can they understand immediately?
No jargon. No ambiguity.
Simple language, simple structure.

CONCISE:
Is every word necessary?
Cut the fluff.
If it can be shorter, make it shorter.

COMPELLING:
Does it create desire?
Benefits over features.
Emotional connection.

CREDIBLE:
Do they believe you?
Proof points. Specifics.
Trust signals.

QUALITY CHECK:

□ CLEAR
- Would my mom understand?
- Is the main point obvious?
- No jargon?

□ CONCISE
- Can I cut 20%?
- Every word earning its place?
- Active voice?

□ COMPELLING
- Benefits stated?
- Emotional hook?
- Would I want this?

□ CREDIBLE
- Numbers included?
- Social proof present?
- Claims proven?

REVISION PROCESS:
Draft 1: Get it out (ignore 4Cs)
Draft 2: Make it CLEAR
Draft 3: Make it CONCISE
Draft 4: Make it COMPELLING
Draft 5: Make it CREDIBLE

Most copy fails on 1-2 Cs.
Great copy nails all 4.
```

## Pattern 5: The Feature-Advantage-Benefit Ladder

**Context:** Translating product features into customer value.

**The Pattern:**
```
FAB = Feature → Advantage → Benefit

FEATURE:
What the product has.
Technical specification.
Factual statement.

ADVANTAGE:
What the feature does.
Functional capability.
The "so what" of the feature.

BENEFIT:
What it means to the user.
Emotional outcome.
How their life improves.

EXAMPLE:

FEATURE:
"256-bit AES encryption"

ADVANTAGE:
"Your data can't be accessed by hackers"

BENEFIT:
"Sleep soundly knowing your customers'
 information is protected"

FAB LADDER:
Feature: 256-bit encryption
    ↓ "What does this do?"
Advantage: Prevents unauthorized access
    ↓ "Why do I care?"
Benefit: Peace of mind

COPY FOCUS:

TECHNICAL AUDIENCE:
Feature (30%) → Advantage (40%) → Benefit (30%)

BUSINESS AUDIENCE:
Feature (20%) → Advantage (30%) → Benefit (50%)

CONSUMER:
Feature (10%) → Advantage (30%) → Benefit (60%)

ALWAYS LEAD WITH BENEFIT:
"Peace of mind, guaranteed.
 256-bit encryption means your data
 stays yours—and yours alone."

Not:
"We use 256-bit encryption
 to protect your data."
```

## Pattern 6: The One Reader Principle

**Context:** Writing for a single person to create universal connection.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Write to one person.
Create your ideal reader.
Speak directly to them.

WHY IT WORKS:
Generic = Ignored
Personal = Connected
"Everyone" is no one
"You specifically" is powerful

CREATING YOUR READER:

Give them a name: Sarah

Sarah is:
- Marketing manager at 50-person company
- Overwhelmed by too many tools
- Technically capable but time-poor
- Values efficiency and simplicity

Ask: "Would Sarah understand this?"
     "Would Sarah care about this?"
     "What would make Sarah click?"

WRITING TO SARAH:

Not: "Businesses can improve efficiency..."
But: "You're drowning in tools. We get it."

Not: "Our solution offers..."
But: "Here's what happens when you sign up..."

Not: "Customers love us"
But: "Sarah from Acme saved 10 hours a week"

ONE READER TECHNIQUE:

1. Create reader profile
2. Write directly to them
3. Use "you" liberally
4. Address their specific situation
5. Speak their language

RESULT:
Paradoxically, writing to one
speaks to many.
Everyone sees themselves in Sarah.
```

THREE-PART COPY BLOCKS:

"Here's what you get:

 • 24/7 support"

"Three steps to success:
 1. Sign up (free)

Pick three. Make them strong.
```
