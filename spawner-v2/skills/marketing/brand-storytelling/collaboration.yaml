# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:

      - Lead with the most important thing
      - Every fact needs attribution
      Apply journalistic rigor to brand stories.
    applies_when: "Mining customer stories and testimonials"

  - domain: Psychology

      - Narrative creates identity
      Understand why stories work on humans.
    applies_when: "Designing for emotional impact"

      - Truth is the foundation of humor
      Apply comedic economy to story telling.
    applies_when: "Creating concise, punchy story versions"

  - domain: Documentary Filmmaking
    insight: |
      Documentarians find truth in footage:
      - 100 hours of interviews becomes 90 minutes of film
      - The best moments are often unscripted
      - B-roll (showing) beats talking heads (telling)

      - Numbers validate story; story humanizes numbers
      Apply data journalism to story-data integration.
    applies_when: "Combining metrics with narrative"

    insight: |
      Oral historians preserve authentic voice:

  notes: |
    Storytelling is fundamentally human skill.
    AI augments but doesn't replace story craft.

    Key considerations:
    - AI generates; humans curate
    - Real customer stories beat invented ones
    - Authenticity can't be automated
    - Story structure is timeless
