    summary: Making the brand the protagonist instead of the customer
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Creating stories where the brand saves the day, the brand is the
      hero, the brand's journey is the focus. Centering the brand in
      every narrative.
    why: |
      Audiences don't care about brands. They care about themselves. When
      the brand is the hero, the customer is just a prop. This creates
      disconnection and feels like advertising. The most powerful stories
      put the customer at the center with the brand as guide/enabler.
    solution: |
      HERO POSITIONING:

      THE CUSTOMER IS THE HERO:
      - They have the problem
      - They take the journey
      - They achieve the transformation
      - They get the credit

      THE BRAND IS THE MENTOR:
      - Yoda, not Luke
      - Gandalf, not Frodo
      - Provides tools, guidance, support
      - Enables the hero's success

      CHECK YOUR STORY:
      - Who is the protagonist?
      - Whose transformation matters?
      - Who gets the victory?
      - If brand → rewrite

      LANGUAGE SHIFT:
      From: "We help you achieve X"
      To: "You can achieve X"

      From: "Our product does Y"
      To: "With Y, you can..."

      # The hero is never the mentor
    symptoms:
      - \'"We, we, we" copy\'
      - Brand logo/name everywhere
      - Customer barely mentioned
      - Feels like boasting

  - id: conflict-avoidance
    summary: Creating stories without real stakes or struggle
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Telling stories where everything is fine, the solution is easy, and
      there's no real tension or conflict. Sanitized, risk-free narratives.
    why: |
      Conflict is what makes stories compelling. Without stakes, there's no
      tension. Without struggle, there's no satisfaction in resolution.
      Conflict-free stories are forgettable because they don't activate the
      emotional systems that make stories stick.
    solution: |
      CONFLICT IS REQUIRED:

      IDENTIFY THE STAKES:
      - What could be lost?
      - What's at risk if nothing changes?
      - Why does this matter?
      - What's the cost of failure?

      SHOW THE STRUGGLE:
      - What obstacles exist?
      - What makes this hard?
      - What did the hero try that didn't work?
      - What moment almost broke them?

      TYPES OF CONFLICT:
      - External: market, competition, circumstances
      - Internal: doubt, fear, uncertainty
      - Interpersonal: skeptics, naysayers

      CONFLICT IN BRAND STORIES:
      - The problem before the solution
      - The doubts about trying something new
      - The challenges during adoption
      - The setbacks before success

      # No conflict = no story
    symptoms:
      - Everything is easy in your stories
      - No mention of challenges
      - Transformation feels unearned
      - Stories feel flat and forgettable

          note: "Success without struggle context"
      fix_template: |
        Add conflict layer:
        1. What was the obstacle?
        2. What made it hard?
        3. What did they try that failed?
        4. What almost made them quit?

  - id: generic-storytelling
    summary: Vague narratives that could apply to any brand
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Creating stories so generic they could have any brand name swapped in.
      No specific details, real names, actual numbers, or unique elements.
    why: |
      Generic stories don't stick. "We helped businesses grow" is not a
      story. Specificity is what makes stories believable and memorable.
      Real names, exact numbers, specific details—these create credibility
      and memorability.
    solution: |
      SPECIFICITY RULES:

      ADD REAL DETAILS:
      - Names: "Sarah, a marketing director in Austin..."
      - Numbers: "increased revenue by 47% in 3 months"
      - Dates: "In March 2024, everything changed..."
      - Places: "In their downtown Denver office..."
      - Quotes: "She said, 'I never thought this was possible'"

      GENERIC → SPECIFIC:
      Before: "A customer was struggling with marketing"
      After: "Rachel had tried 4 different agencies in 2 years.
              Her CAC was $180 and climbing. The board was asking questions."

      UNIQUENESS TEST:
      - Could a competitor tell this exact story?
      - Are there details only we could know?
      - Is there something distinctive here?

      IF TOO GENERIC:
      - Interview actual customers
      - Get real numbers
      - Find unique moments
      - Add texture and detail

      # Specificity = credibility = memorability
    symptoms:
      - Stories could be anyone's
      - No names, numbers, dates
      - Vague "some customers" language
      - Nothing memorable or unique
    detection_pattern:
      type: content_analysis

        □ Exact number (47%, $12k, 3 months)
        □ Specific date or timeframe
        □ Direct quote from customer
        □ Unique detail only you would know

  - id: story-without-stakes
    summary: Narratives where nothing meaningful is at risk
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Telling stories where the outcome doesn't really matter, the hero
      has nothing to lose, and success or failure is inconsequential.
    why: |
      Stakes create engagement. When nothing is at risk, why should anyone
      care? The higher the stakes, the more invested the audience becomes.
      This doesn't mean every story needs life-or-death—but something
      meaningful must be on the line.
    solution: |
      DEFINE THE STAKES:

      LEVELS OF STAKES:
      1. Personal: reputation, confidence, identity
      2. Professional: job, career, success
      3. Financial: money, resources, viability
      4. Relational: team, partnerships, trust
      5. Existential: survival, meaning, purpose

      MAKE STAKES CLEAR:
      - What happens if the hero fails?
      - What's the cost of inaction?
      - Why does this matter to them personally?
      - What would they lose?

      EXAMPLE:
      Low stakes: "A company wanted to improve marketing"
      High stakes: "If Sarah's campaign failed, the startup
                    would miss runway and she'd have to lay off
                    the team she'd spent 2 years building"

      STAKES IN BRAND STORIES:
      - Business survival
      - Career consequences
      - Personal reputation
      - Team impact
      - Customer disappointment

      # If nothing's at risk, it's not a story
    symptoms:
      - Audience doesn't care about outcome
      - Success feels trivial
      - No emotional investment
      - \'"So what?" reaction\'

  - id: feature-story-confusion
    summary: Listing features disguised as storytelling
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Dressing up a feature list with narrative language but without actual
      story structure—no character, no journey, no transformation.
    why: |
      Features aren't stories. "Our AI-powered platform with real-time
      analytics" is information, not narrative. Stories have characters who
      want something, face obstacles, and transform. Features are just
      descriptions.
    solution: |
      FEATURES → STORIES:

      FEATURES ARE PLOT DEVICES, NOT PLOT:
      - The feature is what enables transformation
      - The story is the transformation itself
      - Feature is mentioned, not centered

      TRANSLATION:
      Feature: "Real-time analytics dashboard"
      Story: "Sarah used to spend Fridays pulling reports. Now
              she opens her dashboard Monday morning and knows
              exactly where to focus. Last month she caught a
              problem before it cost them $50k."

      STORY STRUCTURE CHECK:
      □ Is there a character?
      □ Do they want something?
      □ Is there an obstacle?
      □ Is there a transformation?
      □ Does feature enable (not star in) the story?

      IF IT'S FEATURE-FOCUSED:
      - Add a human
      - Add a before/after
      - Show impact on their life
      - Feature becomes tool in their journey

      # Features are props, not protagonists
    symptoms:
      - \'"Story" is really a feature list\'
      - No human in the narrative
      - No before/after

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Creating relentlessly positive narratives where everything is easy,
      everyone is happy, and there are no setbacks or difficulties.
    why: |
      Too-perfect stories feel fake. Audiences are skeptical of narratives
      without shadows. Including authentic struggle makes success more
      meaningful and makes the story more believable.
    solution: |
      AUTHENTIC STRUGGLE:

      INCLUDE:
      - Initial doubts and skepticism
      - Setbacks during implementation
      - Moments of frustration
      - What almost didn't work
      - What they learned from challenges

      DON'T:
      - Invent problems for drama
      - Exaggerate negatives
      - Dwell on failures
      - Be relentlessly negative

      BALANCE:
      - Acknowledge the challenge
      - Show the struggle
      - Celebrate the victory
      - Make success feel earned

      EXAMPLE:
      Fake: "Everything was perfect from day one"
      Real: "The first month was rough. Adoption was slower
             than expected. But by month two, something clicked..."

      # Perfect is suspicious
    symptoms:
      - Everything is too easy

  - id: narrative-inconsistency
    summary: Different stories that contradict each other
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Telling different origin stories, changing the brand narrative,
      contradicting previous testimonials or case studies.
    why: |
      Consistency builds trust. When stories contradict, audiences notice
      and trust erodes. The brand story should be one story told many ways,
      not multiple incompatible stories.
    solution: |
      STORY CONSISTENCY:

      CORE NARRATIVE (immutable):
      - Origin story facts
      - Founding principles
      - Key milestones
      - Core transformation promise

      VARIATIONS (acceptable):
      - Different customer stories
      - Different angles of same story
      - Platform-specific adaptations
      - Audience-specific emphasis

      CONTRADICTIONS (never):
      - Different founding dates
      - Conflicting origin stories
      - Incompatible value claims
      - Changing who did what

      STORY BIBLE:
      - Document the definitive narrative
      - Track what's been told
      - Review for consistency
      - Update centrally

      # One story, many tellings

  - id: telling-not-showing
    summary: Describing instead of demonstrating
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Telling the audience what to think ("We're innovative") instead of
      showing them through story and letting them conclude.
    why: |
      "Show don't tell" is storytelling fundamentals. Telling breeds
      skepticism; showing creates believers. When you say "we're
      innovative," it's a claim. When you show innovation in action,
      it's evidence.
    solution: |
      SHOW DON'T TELL:

      TELLING → SHOWING:
      "We're customer-focused"
      → Story of employee who flew across country for one customer

      "Our product is easy to use"
      → Story of customer who set up in 10 minutes

      "We have great support"
      → Story of support rep who stayed late to solve problem

      TECHNIQUE:
      - Identify claims you're making
      - Find stories that demonstrate claims
      - Let audience reach conclusion themselves
      - Remove the claim, keep the story

      THE TEST:
      If you removed all adjectives, would the audience
      still understand what you're communicating?

      # Don't tell me you're funny—make me laugh

    summary: Stories without evidence or data without narrative
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Either telling emotional stories without proof, or presenting data
      without narrative context. The two divorced from each other.
    why: |
      Stories need data for credibility. Data needs story for meaning.
      Together they're powerful. Apart they're incomplete. Emotion drives
      engagement; proof drives belief.
    solution: |
      MARRY STORY AND DATA:

      STORY + DATA:
      "Sarah grew revenue by 47%"
      + "She finally felt confident presenting to the board"

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Telling narratives that don't show transformation—stories that go
      nowhere, where the character ends up the same as they started.
    why: |
      Transformation is the payoff. Without change, what was the point?
      The audience needs to see and feel the difference the journey made.
      This is what makes stories satisfying and inspiring.
    solution: |
      CLEAR TRANSFORMATION:

      BEFORE STATE:
      - Specific situation
      - Pain points
      - Limitations
      - Emotional state

      AFTER STATE:
      - What changed
      - New capabilities
      - Results achieved
      - Emotional transformation

      TRANSFORMATION TYPES:
      - Capability: Can now do what they couldn't
      - Understanding: Now knows what they didn't
      - Feeling: Confidence, relief, excitement
      - Results: Measurable outcomes

      THE GAP:
      The bigger the gap between before and after,
      the more powerful the story.

      Stories are human. Jargon creates distance. When you say "leveraged

      you're writing a feature announcement. Real humans don't talk like that.
    solution: |
      HUMAN LANGUAGE TEST:

      WOULD A HUMAN SAY THIS?
      - "Leveraged synergies" → NO
      - "Started using the tool" → YES
      - "Optimize workflows" → MAYBE
      - "Get more done in less time" → YES

      TRANSLATION:
      Corporate: "Leveraged our platform to drive outcomes"
      Human: "Used the tool and hit their goals"

      Corporate: "Optimized their go-to-market strategy"
      Human: "Figured out how to sell better"

      Corporate: "Enhanced operational efficiency"
      Human: "Got the work done faster"

      THE READ-ALOUD TEST:
      If you wouldn't say it to your friend over coffee, don't write it.

      COPY-PASTE FIX:
      ```javascript
      const jargonMap = {
        "leverage": "use",
        "utilize": "use",
        "optimize": "improve",
        "synergy": "working together",
        "drive outcomes": "get results",
        "facilitate": "help",
        "implement": "start using",
        "execute": "do"
      };

      function humanizeStory(text) {
        let human = text;
        for (const [jargon, plain] of Object.entries(jargonMap)) {
          human = human.replace(new RegExp(jargon, 'gi'), plain);
        }
        return human;
      }
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Sounds like a press release
      - No one talks like this in real life
      - Buzzword bingo

        Replace jargon with human language:
        1. Read story aloud
        2. Where do you stumble? That's jargon.
        3. Replace with what you'd say to a friend
        4. Verify: Would a 12-year-old understand this?

    summary: Stories without sensory or emotional texture
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Telling stories that are all facts and no feeling. No description of
      what it looked like, sounded like, felt like. Pure information delivery
      without the details that make stories vivid.
    why: |
      Sensory details activate the brain differently than abstract facts.
      "Sarah was frustrated" is abstract. "Sarah threw her laptop charger
      across the room" is concrete. The second creates a movie in the
      reader's mind. That's what makes stories memorable.
    solution: |
      ADD SENSORY TEXTURE:

      TYPES OF DETAILS:
      1. Visual: What did it look like?
         - "The dashboard showed red everywhere"
         - "Three rejected proposals sat in her inbox"

      2. Auditory: What did it sound like?
         - "The Slack notification wouldn't stop pinging"
         - "Her team went quiet when she walked in"

      3. Kinesthetic: What did it feel like physically?
         - "She slumped in her chair"
         - "He paced the conference room"

      4. Emotional: What did it feel like emotionally?
         - "The knot in her stomach tightened"
         - "Relief washed over him"

      5. Temporal: When/how long?
         - "It was 11pm on a Friday"
         - "After six straight hours of calls"

      BEFORE (abstract):
      "The marketing director was stressed about the campaign."

      AFTER (sensory):
      "At 2am, Sarah was still at her desk, the office dark except
      for her screen. The campaign launched in 6 hours and the
      conversion tracking still wasn't working. Her coffee had
      gone cold an hour ago."

      IMPLEMENTATION:
      For each story beat, ask:
      - Where were they? (setting)
      - What time was it? (temporal)
      - What could you see? (visual)
      - What did they do physically? (kinesthetic)
      - How did their body react? (physiological)

      COPY-PASTE TEMPLATE:
      [Character] was [location] at [time]. [Visual detail]. [Physical action].
      [Emotional indicator]. [What was at stake].
    symptoms:
      - Stories feel flat
      - Hard to visualize
      - Purely informational
      - Not immersive
    detection_pattern:
      type: content_analysis
      triggers:
        - pattern: '(story|narrative)(?!.*(looked|felt|saw|heard|noticed|realized|desk|office|room|screen|phone))'
          severity: low
          note: "Abstract story without sensory details"
        - pattern: '\b(frustrated|excited|worried|happy|sad)\b(?!.*(because|when|as|while))'
          severity: low
          note: "Emotion stated but not shown through detail"
      fix_template: |
        Add one sensory detail per story beat:
        □ Where were they? (place)
        □ When was it? (time of day, day of week)
        □ What could you see? (visual detail)
        □ What did they physically do? (action)
        □ How did their body feel? (sensation)
