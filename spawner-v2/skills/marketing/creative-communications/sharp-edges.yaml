  - id: vague-brief
    summary: Briefing creative with unclear objectives
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We need something cool for social." "Make it pop."
      No target audience, no goal, no success criteria.
    why: |
      Creatives produce work that misses the mark. Multiple rounds of revisions
      trying to hit an undefined target. Time and money wasted.
      Tension between stakeholders and creative team.
    solution: |
      Every brief must include:
      □ Target audience (who are we speaking to?)
      □ Objective (what do we want them to do?)
      □ Key message (what's the one thing?)
      □ Success criteria (how do we know it worked?)
      □ Constraints (budget, timeline, mandatories)

      No exceptions. No briefs without these elements.
    symptoms:
      - "I'll know it when I see it"
      - Endless revision cycles
      - Creative misses the mark
      - Stakeholder frustration

  - id: revision-spiral
    summary: Endless rounds of changes without clear decision-maker
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Each stakeholder adds feedback. Scope creeps with each round.
      "One more small change" becomes ten more changes.
    why: |
      Deadlines missed. Creative quality degrades with over-revision.
      Team burns out. Costs spiral. Final product is a camel designed by committee.
    solution: |
      - Defined approval process with clear decision-maker
      - Maximum revision rounds specified upfront
      - Consolidated feedback (one voice to creative)
      - Time-boxed review periods

      # Revision structure:
      Round 1: Major feedback
      Round 2: Refinements
      Round 3: Final tweaks only
      No Round 4
    symptoms:
      - Dozens of revision rounds
      - No clear approver
      - Deadlines slipping
      - Team burnout

  - id: off-brand-asset
    summary: Creating assets that don't follow brand guidelines
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Wrong logo usage, off-palette colors, inconsistent typography.
      Each piece looks like a different company.
    why: |
      Erodes brand recognition. Looks unprofessional.
      Undermines all the equity built in brand. Confuses customers.
    solution: |
      - Accessible, clear brand guidelines
      - Brand review as mandatory checkpoint
      - Templates for common asset types
      - Brand training for all creative contributors

      # Brand review checklist:
      □ Logo usage correct
      □ Colors match palette
      □ Typography follows hierarchy
      □ Tone matches voice guidelines
    symptoms:
      - Inconsistent look across assets
      - Brand police constantly fixing
      - External vendors go off-brand
      - No brand recognition
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: platform-mismatch
    summary: Creating one asset and forcing it into every platform
    severity: high
    situation: |
      TV spot cropped for Instagram Stories. Print ad repurposed for Twitter.
      Same asset everywhere without adaptation.
    why: |
      Cropped visuals that miss key elements. Wrong aspect ratios.
      Text too small to read. Captions cut off. Looks lazy and unprofessional.
    solution: |
      - Design for each platform from the start
      - Lead platform first, then adapt (don't just resize)
      - Understand platform constraints before creating
      - Platform-specific asset checklists

      # Platform considerations:
      - Aspect ratios
      - Text safe zones
      - Video length limits
      - Audio requirements
      - Interactive elements
    symptoms:
      - Cropped/stretched assets
      - Text cut off or unreadable
      - Videos wrong length
      - Assets look amateur
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: uncleared-asset
    summary: Using photos, music, fonts without proper licensing
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Stock photos used beyond license scope. Music in video without sync rights.
      Downloaded from Google Images. Used "temp" music and shipped it.
    why: |
      Legal exposure. Takedown notices. Lawsuits from rights holders.
      Embarrassing removal of published content. Fines.
    solution: |
      - Clear rights for everything before production
      - Maintain asset license database
      - Never use "temp" assets in final work
      - When in doubt, don't use it

      # License checklist:
      □ Commercial use allowed
      □ Scope covers intended use
      □ Duration covers campaign
      □ Territory covers markets
      □ License documented and stored
    symptoms:
      - Takedown notices
      - Legal letters from rights holders
      - Emergency asset replacements
      - Unknown license status

  - id: approval-bottleneck
    summary: Creative sitting in approval queue while deadlines pass
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Key approver unavailable. No escalation path. Creative blocked for weeks.
      Deadline missed while waiting for approval.
    why: |
      Missed deadlines. Campaigns delayed. Creative teams blocked.
      Last-minute rushing when approval finally comes.
    solution: |
      - Defined SLAs for approval
      - Backup approvers for each role
      - Escalation process
      - Approval timeboxes
      - Tools that surface approval needs prominently

      # Approval structure:
      - 24-hour SLA for minor assets
      - 48-hour SLA for major assets
      - Backup approver if primary unavailable
      - Auto-escalation after SLA
    symptoms:
      - Assets stuck in review
      - '"Waiting for approval" status'
      - Missed deadlines
      - Approvers overloaded

  - id: single-use-asset
    summary: Creating expensive creative that can only be used once
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Highly specific headlines, dated references, single-platform optimization.
      Expensive creative with no reuse potential.
    why: |
      High cost per use. Constantly creating from scratch.
      No asset library to leverage. Inefficient creative operations.
    solution: |
      - Design for modularity where possible
      - Create master assets that can be adapted
      - Build asset library
      - Consider longevity in brief

      # Reusability checklist:
      □ Can this be adapted for other platforms?
      □ Is the message evergreen or dated?
      □ Can elements be reused?
      □ Are we building library assets?
    symptoms:
      - Starting from scratch each time
      - No asset library
      - High creative costs
      - Duplicate effort across campaigns
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: literal-interpretation
    summary: Creative that just illustrates the product literally
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Showing a laptop to sell software. Stock photos of "business people."
      Just depicting the product, not the benefit or emotion.
    why: |
      Invisible in crowded markets. Doesn't differentiate.
      Boring. Fails to connect emotionally. No memorability.
    solution: |
      - Brief for emotion and differentiation, not just depiction
      - Push for concepts that surprise
      - Show the benefit, not just the product
      - Take creative risks worth taking

      # Creative direction:
      Literal: "Show people using our software"
      Better: "Show the feeling of finally being organized"

      Show outcomes, not just products
    symptoms:
      - Interchangeable with competitors
      - Boring, forgettable creative
      - No emotional connection
      - Safe but invisible
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: unfeedbackable-feedback
    summary: Giving vague feedback creative can't act on
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Make it more premium." "It needs more energy."
      "I'll know it when I see it." Subjective, vague, unactionable.
    why: |
      Endless rounds trying to guess what's wanted.
      Frustrated creative team. Wasted time. Relationship damage.
    solution: |
      - Train stakeholders on giving actionable feedback
      - "Instead of X, try Y because Z"
      - Reference examples
      - Tie feedback to brief objectives

      # Actionable feedback format:
      Not: "Make it pop more"
      But: "The headline doesn't stand out. Can we increase contrast
            or make the font bolder so it reads faster?"

      Always: "How does this fail to achieve the stated goal?"
    symptoms:
      - Creative can't act on feedback
      - Multiple interpretations of notes
      - Guessing what stakeholder wants
      - Revision roulette

  - id: over-produced-asset
    summary: Creating expensive content when low-fi would work better
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Agency-quality video for organic social. Studio photography for Stories.
      High production value where authenticity wins.
    why: |
      Slow to produce. Expensive. Often outperformed by authentic, lower-production
      content. Wrong fit for platform.
    solution: |
      - Match production level to platform and purpose
      - Test lo-fi before committing to hi-fi
      - Embrace authenticity where appropriate
      - Production value should serve strategy, not ego

      # Production matching:
      Brand campaign: High production
      Organic social: Authentic, lower production
      Ads: Depends on platform
      Stories/TikTok: Often lo-fi wins
    symptoms:
      - Lo-fi content outperforms expensive content
      - Slow production cycles
      - High costs for low-engagement platforms
      - Over-polished for context
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: orphan-asset
    summary: Creating great creative that never gets distributed
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Perfect video sitting on hard drives. Assets created but never launched.
      Campaign killed. Strategy changed. Approval never came.
    why: |
      Complete waste of resources. Demoralized creative team. Sunk costs.
    solution: |
      - Distribution planning before production
      - Launch commitment before investment
      - Kill projects early if strategy changes
      - Better to produce less that ships than more that doesn't

      # Pre-production checkpoint:
      □ Distribution channels confirmed
      □ Launch date committed
      □ Approvers identified and available
      □ Budget approved end-to-end
    symptoms:
      - Assets never published
      - Drives full of unused work
      - Strategy changes after production
      - Creative team demoralized

  - id: translation-disaster
    summary: Localizing creative poorly without cultural context
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Literal translations that miss cultural context. Imagery that doesn't resonate
      or offends. Messages that don't land in new markets.
    why: |
      Messages that don't land. Cultural insensitivity.
      Brand damage in new markets. Wasted localization investment.
    solution: |
      - Cultural review alongside translation
      - Local market experts involved early
      - Test with target market audiences
      - Some concepts don't translate—create new ones

      # Localization checklist:
      □ Meaning preserved, not just words
      □ Cultural context considered
      □ Imagery appropriate for market
      □ Local expert reviewed
      □ In-market testing conducted
    symptoms:
      - Awkward translations
      - Cultural missteps
      - Poor performance in new markets
      - Negative local reception
