    summary: Not clearly disclosing AI/synthetic nature
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Creating a synthetic influencer without clearly disclosing in bio and
      content that they are AI-generated/virtual. Trying to pass as human.
    why: |
      Destroys trust when discovered. Potentially illegal (FTC guidelines on
      disclosure). Creates PR disaster. The whole value proposition of synthetic
      influencers includes transparency—they're consistent BECAUSE they're synthetic.
      Hiding it undermines everything.
    solution: |
      MANDATORY DISCLOSURE:

      BIO DISCLOSURE:
      - "AI-generated" or "Virtual" clearly stated
      - First line or clearly visible
      - Not hidden in emoji soup

      CONTENT DISCLOSURE:
      - Regular acknowledgment of synthetic nature
      - Can be playful ("As an AI...")
      - Don't pretend to do human things (eating, sleeping)

      LEGAL REQUIREMENTS:
      - FTC requires disclosure for advertising
      - Platform TOS may require disclosure
      - Different countries have different rules
      - When in doubt, disclose more

      BRAND PROTECTION:
      - Be proud of being synthetic
      - Lean into the unique advantages
      - Never claim to be human
      - Transparency = trust

      # Synthetic is a feature, not a secret to hide
    symptoms:
      - \'"Is this a real person?" confusion\'
      - Discovery → betrayal response
      - Platform violations
      - Legal/regulatory issues

    summary: Pushing for hyper-realism and landing in uncanny valley
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Trying to make synthetic influencer look perfectly human, but achieving
      something unsettling—almost human but wrong enough to disturb.
    why: |
      The uncanny valley is real. Almost-human-but-not-quite triggers discomfort.
      Audiences find it creepy. Better to be clearly stylized OR perfectly
      photorealistic. The middle ground is dangerous.
    solution: |
      VISUAL STRATEGY OPTIONS:

      OPTION 1: STYLIZED (safe)
      - Clearly animated/illustrated look
      - Artistic style that doesn't try to be photo-real
      - Examples: Illustrated characters, 3D stylized
      - Pro: Avoids uncanny valley entirely

      OPTION 2: PHOTOREALISTIC (high skill required)
      - Indistinguishable from human photography
      - Requires top-tier generation
      - Careful attention to details (eyes, skin, hair)
      - Review every asset for uncanny tells

      AVOID: THE MIDDLE
      - Realistic style with wrong details
      - Dead eyes, wrong lighting on skin
      - Inconsistent features
      - This is where uncanny valley lives

      UNCANNY VALLEY TELLS:
      - Eyes that don't quite focus
      - Skin that's too smooth or too uniform
      - Hair that doesn't behave like hair
      - Facial proportions slightly off
      - Expressions that don't reach eyes

      # Pick a lane and commit
    symptoms:
      - \'"Something's off" comments\'
      - \'"Creepy" reactions\'
      - Lower engagement than expected
      - Audience discomfort

  - id: personality-inconsistency
    summary: Synthetic influencer with inconsistent personality
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Different posts feel like different people. Voice, opinions, style
      shifts based on who's writing or what's trending.
    why: |
      Humans are somewhat inconsistent. Synthetic influencers can be perfectly
      consistent—that's their advantage. If personality drifts, audiences notice.
      The synthetic nature is revealed by inconsistency, not concealed by it.
      Personality consistency IS the authenticity.
    solution: |
      PERSONA BIBLE ENFORCEMENT:

      DOCUMENT EVERYTHING:
      - Speaking style (specific examples)
      - Phrases they use (catchphrases)
      - Phrases they NEVER use
      - Opinion positions on relevant topics
      - Humor style
      - Emoji usage patterns
      - Caption structure

      BEFORE EVERY POST:
      □ Does this sound like [name]?
      □ Would they say this this way?
      □ Is this consistent with their values?
      □ Does the humor match?

      REVIEW PROCESS:
      - Single voice lead/editor
      - Review against recent posts
      - Character bible check
      - Kill anything that feels off

      TEAM TRAINING:
      - Everyone knows the persona
      - Examples of right/wrong voice
      - Regular calibration

      # Consistency is the authenticity
    symptoms:
      - Different "vibe" between posts
      - Contradictory opinions/preferences
      - Audience confusion about personality
      - Character drift over time

  - id: all-promotion-no-value
    summary: Synthetic influencer that only pushes products
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Every post is a product promotion. No entertainment, no value, no
      personality beyond brand messaging. Just an ad delivery vehicle.
    why: |
      Audiences don't follow ads. They follow interesting entities that
      occasionally promote things. If synthetic influencer is 100% promotion,
      why would anyone follow? The content ratio matters. Entertainment first,
      promotion integrated naturally.
    solution: |
      CONTENT RATIO:

      80/20 RULE:
      - 80% entertainment/value/personality
      - 20% promotion (at most)
      - Promotion should feel natural
      - Never interrupt value for ads

      VALUE CONTENT:
      - Entertainment (funny, interesting, beautiful)
      - Information (tips, insights, education)
      - Community (engagement, responses, conversations)
      - Personality (opinions, experiences, stories)

      PROMOTIONAL CONTENT:
      - Integrated into personality
      - Not interruptive
      - Authentic to character
      - Provides value alongside promotion

      CONTENT CALENDAR:
      - Plan promotion sparingly
      - Surrounded by value content
      - Never back-to-back promotions
      - Promotional content still entertaining

      # Would you follow someone who only tries to sell you stuff?
    symptoms:
      - Low follower growth
      - Poor engagement
      - \'"They just shill stuff" comments\'
      - Audience skepticism

  - id: community-neglect
    summary: Posting without genuine engagement
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Synthetic influencer posts content but never responds to comments,
      never engages with community, never builds relationships.
    why: |
      Influencer marketing is about community, not broadcast. Even synthetic
      influencers need community building. Posting without engaging is just
      advertising. The magic is in making audience feel seen.
    solution: |
      ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

      COMMENT RESPONSES:
      - Respond to comments (human-assisted)
      - Personality-consistent responses
      - Acknowledge regulars
      - Don't use generic responses

      COMMUNITY BUILDING:
      - Ask questions
      - Create participation opportunities
      - Celebrate community members
      - Remember regular engagers

      RESPONSE TIME:
      - First hour is critical
      - Active engagement window after posting
      - Don't leave comments hanging

      HUMAN-AI HYBRID:
      - AI can draft responses
      - Human review for appropriateness
      - Persona consistency check
      - Authentic feel required

      DM STRATEGY:
      - Clear about being AI
      - Helpful within limits
      - Know when to redirect to humans
      - Never pretend to be human in DMs

      # Community is built through engagement, not broadcast
    symptoms:
      - Low comment counts
      - No repeat engagers
      - \'"They never respond" comments\'
      - Hollow follower count

  - id: static-character
    summary: Synthetic influencer that never grows or changes
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Same personality, same content, same everything for months. No evolution,
      no growth, no new developments. Character feels frozen.
    why: |
      Real-feeling entities evolve. People grow, change, have new experiences.
      A character that never changes feels dead. Planned evolution keeps
      character fresh and gives audience something to follow.
    solution: |
      EVOLUTION PLANNING:

      GROWTH ARCS:
      - Quarterly character developments
      - New interests/skills developing
      - Evolving opinions (consistently)
      - New relationships/connections

      NARRATIVE ELEMENTS:
      - Events that happen to character
      - Milestones to celebrate
      - Challenges to overcome
      - Goals to pursue

      CHANGE MANAGEMENT:
      - Evolution should feel natural
      - Never contradict core personality
      - Reference past developments
      - Let audience "grow with" character

      CONTENT TYPES:
      - \'"Learning something new" content\'
      - "Trying something for first time"
      - "My opinion evolved on X"
      - "Milestone reached"

      DOCUMENTATION:
      - Track character evolution
      - Timeline of developments
      - Maintain consistency in growth
      - Update persona bible

      # Even synthetic beings should seem alive
    symptoms:
      - \'"Same old content" fatigue\'
      - Declining engagement over time
      - Character feels one-dimensional
      - Audience loses interest

  - id: cross-platform-inconsistency
    summary: Different persona on different platforms
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Synthetic influencer on Instagram feels different from TikTok version
      feels different from Twitter version. Not just format adaptation—
      personality inconsistency.
    why: |
      Audiences follow across platforms. If the same character feels different
      on each platform, it breaks immersion. Format should adapt; personality
      should not. The character is the same person everywhere.
    solution: |
      PLATFORM ADAPTATION RULES:

      CORE (SAME EVERYWHERE):
      - Personality traits
      - Voice and language
      - Values and opinions
      - Visual identity
      - Backstory and lore

      ADAPTED (PLATFORM-SPECIFIC):
      - Content format
      - Posting frequency
      - Trend participation style
      - Technical specifications
      - Hashtag/tag usage

      PLATFORM GUIDES:
      - Instagram: polished, aesthetic, lifestyle
      - TikTok: casual, trend-aware, raw
      - Twitter: opinion, conversation, real-time
      - YouTube: long-form, deeper personality
      - Discord: community, direct engagement

      SAME CHARACTER, DIFFERENT CONTEXT:
      Think of it like a person acting differently at:
      - Work vs home vs party
      - Still the same person
      - Adapting to context, not changing identity

      # Same person, different context
    symptoms:
      - "Are these the same character?"
      - Cross-platform followers confused
      - Inconsistent audience perception
      - Brand dilution

  - id: no-controversy-strategy
    summary: No plan for when synthetic influencer faces criticism
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Building synthetic influencer without planning for criticism, backlash,
      or "cancellation" attempts. Assuming it will all be positive.
    why: |
      Every public figure faces criticism eventually. Synthetic influencers
      aren't immune—if anything, the synthetic nature invites debate. Need a
      plan for handling criticism while maintaining character.
    solution: |
      CONTROVERSY PLANNING:

      PREVENTION:
      - Topic boundaries clearly defined
      - Regular content review
      - Cultural sensitivity checks
      - Nothing that could age badly

      RESPONSE FRAMEWORK:
      For minor criticism:
      - In-character response if appropriate
      - Acknowledge, move on
      - Don't feed trolls

      For significant issues:
      - Pause posting
      - Assess actual concern
      - Craft appropriate response
      - May need brand acknowledgment (not just character)

      For major problems:
      - Full pause
      - Brand-level response
      - Character can evolve/apologize if appropriate
      - Consider if character can continue

      CANCELLATION RESPONSE:
      - Synthetic influencer can evolve
      - Can address criticism in character
      - Brand is ultimately accountable
      - Character can be retired if needed

      # Plan for problems before they happen
    symptoms:
      - Unprepared for criticism
      - Inconsistent responses to issues
      - Brand scrambling
      - Reputation damage

    summary: Running synthetic influencer without understanding platform rules
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Creating synthetic influencer without understanding each platform's
      rules about AI, disclosure, advertising, and synthetic content.
    why: |
      Platforms have rules about synthetic content, and they're evolving.
      Violations can result in bans, shadow-banning, or worse. Need to
      understand and follow platform-specific requirements.
    solution: |

      KNOW THE RULES:
      - Each platform's AI/synthetic content policy
      - Disclosure requirements
      - Advertising guidelines
      - Content restrictions

      COMMON REQUIREMENTS:
      - Instagram: FTC disclosure for ads
      - TikTok: Synthetic content labeling (evolving)
      - YouTube: Disclosure for AI-generated
      - Twitter: Bot/AI account labeling

      MONITORING:
      - Platform policy updates
      - Industry news
      - Compliance changes
      - New requirements

      DOCUMENTATION:

      - Stay ahead of requirements

      # Platforms make the rules. Know them.
    symptoms:
      - Account restrictions
      - Content removal
      - Shadow-banning

  - id: wrong-use-case
    summary: Using synthetic influencer where human would be better
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Forcing synthetic influencer into situations where a human would be
      clearly superior—authentic personal stories, real experiences, genuine
      emotion.
    why: |
      Synthetic influencers have strengths (consistency, availability, control)
      and weaknesses (authenticity, real experience, genuine emotion). Using
      them where humans excel wastes their advantages and highlights their limits.
    solution: |
      SYNTHETIC STRENGTHS:
      - Perfect consistency
      - 24/7 availability
      - Zero scandal risk
      - Complete brand control
      - Infinite scalability
      - Fantasy/impossible scenarios

      SYNTHETIC WEAKNESSES:
      - Genuine personal experience
      - Real emotion
      - Authentic struggle stories
      - Human connection moments
      - Physical presence requirements
      - Spontaneous real-world interaction

      BEST USE CASES:
      - Brand mascot/spokesperson
      - Fantasy/aspirational content
      - Consistent messaging at scale
      - Creative/artistic expression
      - Educational character
      - Entertainment persona

      AVOID:
      - Pretending to have real experiences
      - \'"My personal journey" content\'
      - Authentic vulnerability (that requires being real)
      - Situations requiring physical presence
      - Crisis empathy that needs to feel human

      # Use the right tool for the job
    symptoms:
      - \'"This feels fake" reactions\'
      - Trying to force authenticity
      - Uncomfortable content
      - Missed opportunities for actual humans
