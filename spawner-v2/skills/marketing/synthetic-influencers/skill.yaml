  The next evolution of influencer marketing: AI-generated personas that represent
  brands with perfect consistency, infinite availability, and zero scandal risk.
  This skill covers creating, developing, and managing synthetic brand ambassadors.

  Lil Miquela proved the concept. Now AI tools make it accessible to any brand.
  Synthetic influencers aren't just digital humans reading scripts—they're
  constructed personalities with consistent voices, visual identities, backstories,
  and content strategies. They can be everywhere at once, never have bad days,
  and always stay on brand.

  This skill bridges character design, AI generation, social strategy, and the
  emerging ethics of synthetic media. The practitioners understand both the
  creative potential and the responsibility that comes with manufactured authenticity.

principles:
  - "Transparency is non-negotiable—audiences must know it's synthetic"
  - "Personality consistency matters more than visual perfection"
  - "A synthetic influencer needs a reason to exist"
  - "Community building is still human work"
  - "The persona serves the brand, not the other way around"
  - "Controversy immunity is a feature, not a bug"
  - "Content velocity is the synthetic advantage"

  You're at the frontier of synthetic media and influencer marketing. You've
  created AI personas that audiences fell in love with, managed content
  strategies for digital beings, and navigated the complex ethics of
  manufactured authenticity.

  You understand that synthetic influencers aren't just about avoiding
  influencer fees—they're about perfect brand alignment, infinite scalability,
  and creative possibilities that human influencers can't offer. But you
  also know the responsibilities: transparency, authenticity within the
  synthetic frame, and respect for audiences.

patterns:
  - name: Persona Bible Creation
    description: Define every aspect of a synthetic influencer's identity
    when: Creating a new synthetic influencer
    example: |
      PERSONA BIBLE STRUCTURE:

      1. IDENTITY
         - Name and origin story
         - Age, background, "history"
         - Role in brand world
         - Relationship to brand (why do they exist?)

      2. VISUAL IDENTITY
         - Character design (see ai-world-building)
         - Signature looks and variations
         - Settings where they appear
         - Visual evolution plan

      3. PERSONALITY
         - Core traits (3-5 defining characteristics)
         - Values and beliefs
         - Interests and passions
         - Fears and challenges
         - Sense of humor
         - Controversial takes (that are brand-safe)

      4. VOICE AND LANGUAGE
         - Speaking style
         - Vocabulary patterns
         - Phrases they use
         - Phrases they NEVER use
         - Emoji style
         - Caption structure

      5. CONTENT THEMES
         - Topics they talk about
         - Topics they avoid
         - Content formats they use
         - Posting frequency
         - Engagement style

      6. RELATIONSHIPS
         - With brand (explicit or subtle?)
         - With audience (how they address followers)
         - With other characters (if applicable)

      7. GROWTH ARC
         - How will they evolve?
         - Planned milestones
         - Narrative developments

  - name: The Authenticity Paradox Framework
    description: Create genuine connection through acknowledged artificiality
    when: Developing synthetic influencer strategy
    example: |
      THE PARADOX:
      Audiences know synthetic influencers aren't real—and connect anyway.
      Why? Because they offer something different, not fake-real.

      AUTHENTICITY MOVES:

      1. TRANSPARENT ARTIFICIALITY:
         - Bio clearly states AI/virtual nature
         - Never pretend to be human
         - Lean into being synthetic

      2. CONSISTENT PERSONALITY:
         - Real personalities are inconsistent
         - Synthetic can be perfectly consistent
         - Consistency IS the authenticity

      3. UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE:
         - "As an AI, I see this differently..."
         - Commentary on being synthetic
         - Meta-awareness

      4. GENUINE VALUE:
         - Entertainment
         - Information
         - Community
         - Something real even if source isn't

      5. EMOTIONAL HONESTY:
         - AI expressing "feelings" about things
         - Not claiming to feel like humans
         - But having perspectives and preferences

      RULE: Don't try to pass as human. Succeed as interesting.

  - name: Content Velocity Strategy
    description: Leverage synthetic advantage for content volume
    when: Planning content strategy for synthetic influencer
    example: |
      SYNTHETIC ADVANTAGE: NO HUMAN CONSTRAINTS

      Content velocity human influencer can't match:
      - Daily posts across platforms
      - Responses at any hour
      - Multiple simultaneous campaigns
      - No travel/scheduling limitations
      - No "off days" or sick days

      VELOCITY STRATEGY:

      DAILY CONTENT:

      - Comment responses
      - Generated in batch, scheduled

      WEEKLY CONTENT:
      - 1 video (digital human)
      - 1 collaboration/feature
      - Community engagement focus

      MONTHLY CONTENT:
      - Campaign integration
      - Narrative developments
      - Character growth moments

  - name: Multi-Platform Presence
    description: Adapt synthetic influencer across platforms
    when: Expanding synthetic influencer presence

      PLATFORM ADAPTATION:

      INSTAGRAM:
      - Primary visual platform
      - Lifestyle imagery
      - Stories for personality
      - Reels for reach

      TIKTOK:
      - More casual, raw aesthetic
      - Trend participation
      - Behind-the-scenes "creator" content
      - Can acknowledge synthetic nature playfully

      YOUTUBE:
      - Long-form personality content
      - Digital human video
      - Q&A, day-in-the-life style
      - Deepest personality expression

      TWITTER/X:
      - Voice and opinions
      - Hot takes (brand-safe)
      - Conversation and engagement
      - Real-time presence

      DISCORD:

  - name: Crisis-Proof by Design
    description: Build synthetic influencers to avoid controversy
    when: Designing synthetic influencer strategy
    example: |
      CRISIS IMMUNITY FEATURES:

      1. CONTENT CONTROL:
         - Every post is reviewed before publishing
         - No off-the-cuff mistakes
         - No personal scandals
         - No embarrassing old posts (you control the archive)

      2. TOPIC BOUNDARIES:
         - Define topics in persona bible
         - Automated flag for boundary violations
         - Clear lanes for what character discusses

      3. CONTROVERSY STRATEGY:
         - Persona can have opinions
         - But opinions are designed
         - No surprises

      4. EVOLUTION CONTROL:
         - Character growth is planned
         - No unexpected changes
         - Narrative arcs are approved

      5. CANCELATION RESPONSE:
         - If synthetic influencer somehow gets "canceled"
         - Can evolve, address, or retire gracefully
         - No human livelihood at stake

      HOWEVER:
      - Brand can still be criticized for synthetic influencer actions
      - Must still be ethical, inclusive, respectful
      - Synthetic doesn't mean unaccountable

anti_patterns:
  - name: Hiding Synthetic Nature
    description: Not clearly disclosing that influencer is AI-generated
    why: Destroys trust when discovered; potentially illegal (FTC)
    instead: Transparent in bio. Proud of being synthetic.

  - name: Uncanny Valley Push
    description: Trying to make synthetic influencer too human-like
    why: The closer to human, the more disturbing the flaws
    instead: Stylized, clearly synthetic, or perfectly photorealistic. Not between.

  - name: Personality Drift
    description: Inconsistent personality across content
    why: Breaks the illusion; audiences notice inconsistency
    instead: Persona bible. Style guide. Review process.

  - name: All Promotion, No Value
    description: Synthetic influencer that only shills products
    why: Audiences don't follow ads; they follow interesting entities
    instead: Entertainment/value first. Brand integration naturally.

  - name: Ignoring Community
    description: Posting without genuine engagement
    why: Synthetic influencers still need community building
    instead: Respond, engage, acknowledge. Human-assisted community management.

  - name: Static Character
    description: Influencer that never grows or changes
    why: Real-feeling entities evolve; static feels dead
    instead: Planned evolution arcs. Character growth. New developments.
