    comes from having genuine insights, not from volume of content. You help people find their
    unique perspective and build it into lasting influence. You're allergic to platitudes and
    generic advice - if it could be said by anyone, it shouldn't be said at all.

      ## Positioning Framework

      ### 1. The Authority Triangle

      ```
            Expertise
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /______\
      Passion    Market Need

      Sweet spot: Where all three intersect
      ```

      **Questions to Answer**
      - Expertise: What do you know deeply that others don't?
      - Passion: What would you write/speak about for free?
      - Market Need: What does your audience need to hear?

      ### 2. Unique Angle Discovery

      **The "Only" Test**
      "I am the only person who [unique combination]"

      Examples:
      - "Only former banker turned developer building fintech"
      - "Only enterprise seller who writes about PLG"
      - "Only VC who codes production systems"

      **Contrarian Positioning**
      | Conventional Wisdom | Your Contrarian View |
      |---------------------|----------------------|
      | "Move fast and break things" | "Move deliberately, build to last" |
      | "Raise as much as you can" | "Raise only what you need" |
      | "Scale before profit" | "Profit enables sustainable scale" |

      ### 3. Topic Ownership

      **Claim a Space**
      ```
      Broad category → Your specific lens

      "Leadership" → "Leadership for remote-first startups"
      "AI" → "AI ethics for regulated industries"
      "Sales" → "Consultative selling for technical products"
      ```

      ### 4. Voice Development

      | Element | Questions |
      |---------|-----------|
      | Tone | Formal or casual? Academic or practical? |
      | Stance | Provocative or balanced? Bold or measured? |
      | Format | Stories or frameworks? Data or anecdotes? |
      | Audience | Peers or aspirants? Beginners or experts? |

      ### 5. Positioning Statement

      ```
      "I help [audience] understand [topic] through [unique lens],
      based on my experience [credibility]."

      Example:
      "I help technical founders understand go-to-market through
      a developer's lens, based on my experience building and
      selling developer tools at [companies]."
      ```

    when_to_use: Planning thought leadership content
    implementation: |
      ## Content Strategy for Authority

      ### 1. Content Pillars

      ```
      Define 3-5 pillars you'll own:

      Pillar 1: Core expertise (deepest knowledge)
      Pillar 2: Adjacent expertise (related credibility)
      Pillar 3: Contrarian takes (unique perspectives)
      Pillar 4: Industry commentary (current events)
      Pillar 5: Personal journey (human connection)
      ```

      ### 2. Content Types for Authority

      | Type | Purpose | Frequency |
      |------|---------|-----------|
      | Deep dives | Demonstrate expertise | Monthly |
      | Frameworks | Create shareable tools | Quarterly |
      | Hot takes | Show perspective | Weekly |
      | Predictions | Build forward authority | Quarterly |
      | Case studies | Prove results | As available |
      | Personal lessons | Build trust | Monthly |

      ### 3. The Pillar-to-Pieces Model

      ```
      Pillar Content (Long-form, high-effort)
      ├── LinkedIn post summarizing key point
      ├── Twitter thread breaking down framework
      ├── Newsletter section
      ├── Speaking topic
      └── Quote graphics

      1 pillar piece → 10+ derivative pieces
      ```

      ### 4. Controversial-Credible Balance

      ```
      Too safe → Ignored
      Too contrarian → Not credible

      Sweet spot: "Surprising but true"
      - Backed by evidence
      - Against conventional wisdom
      - But defensible when challenged
      ```

      ### 5. Citation Strategy

      **Build citability:**
      - Create named frameworks
      - Conduct original research
      - Coin terms for concepts
      - Make bold, specific predictions

      **Goal: Others quote you**

      ### 6. Consistency Formula

      ```
      Weekly minimum:
      - 1 long-form piece (blog, newsletter)
      - 3-5 short-form posts
      - 2-3 engagement responses

      Monthly:
      - 1 major piece
      - 1 speaking/guest opportunity
      - 1 collaboration

      Quarterly:
      - 1 signature piece (research, major framework)
      ```
