      ### What to Say Instead

      | Don't Say | Do Say |
      |-----------|--------|
      | "I'm a thought leader" | "I focus on X" |
      | "Leading expert" | "I've spent 10 years on X" |
      | "Guru" | "I help people with X" |
      | "Visionary" | "I believe X will happen" |

      Let your work speak. Let others anoint you.

  - id: platitude-content
    summary: Publishing generic advice
    severity: high
    situation: Content is forgettable and interchangeable
    why: |
      Generic content has no value.
      Anyone could have said it.
      Wastes audience attention.
    solution: |
      ## Creating Non-Generic Content

      ### The Substitution Test

      ```
      If you could put anyone else's name on this content
      and it would still work, it's not thought leadership.

      Good: "When I was at [company], we discovered..."
      Bad: "Communication is important for teams"
      ```

      ### Non-Generic Content Types

      **Experience-Based**
      - What you learned from failure
      - What surprised you
      - What you'd do differently

      **Contrarian**
      - What you disagree with
      - Why common advice is wrong
      - Unpopular but true

      **Novel Framework**
      - New way to think about problem
      - Named methodology
      - Unique synthesis

      **Specific Data**
      - Your research
      - Your numbers
      - Your observations

      ### Platitude Detection

      | Platitude | Add Specificity |
      |-----------|-----------------|
      | "Hire great people" | "Here's my exact interview process" |
      | "Focus on customers" | "We talk to 5 customers/week using..." |
      | "Move fast" | "We ship daily because of this process" |
      | "Culture matters" | "We fired our top performer because..." |

      ### The "So What" Test

      After every statement, ask "So what?"
      If you can't answer with specific implication, cut it.
    symptoms:
      - Content could be said by anyone
      - Low engagement
      - Nothing memorable
    detection_pattern: "generic|platitude|obvious"

  - id: expertise-without-humility
    summary: Never admitting uncertainty
    severity: medium
    situation: Appears arrogant or out of touch
    why: |
      Nobody knows everything.
      False confidence erodes trust.
      Leaves no room to learn publicly.
    solution: |
      ## Confident Humility

      ### Balance Formula

      ```
      Strong opinions + Openness to new data

      "Based on my experience, I believe X.
       Here's my evidence.
       I could be wrong if Y."
      ```

      ### Signaling Expertise + Humility

      **Claim Expertise On**
      - What you've done
      - Data you've seen
      - Decisions you've made

      **Acknowledge Limits On**
      - What's outside experience
      - Where data is limited
      - Rapidly changing areas

      ### Humility Phrases

      | Arrogant | Humble but Confident |
      |----------|----------------------|
      | "The answer is X" | "In my experience, X" |
      | "You should always" | "What's worked for me" |
      | "Wrong approach" | "I'd consider instead" |
      | "Obviously" | "What I've found" |

      ### Learning in Public

      ```
      Share:
      - What you got wrong
      - How your views evolved
      - What you're still figuring out

      This builds more trust than perfection.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Seen as arrogant
      - Pushback in comments
      - No nuance in positions
    detection_pattern: "always|never|obviously|everyone knows"

  - id: platform-burnout
    summary: Unsustainable content pace
    severity: medium
    situation: Exhausted by content creation
    why: |
      Started too ambitiously.
      Not sustainable long-term.
      Quality suffers.
    solution: |
      ## Sustainable Thought Leadership

      ### Pace Calculation

      ```
      Sustainable pace = (Hours available / Hours per piece)

      Example:
      - 4 hours/week for content
      - 2 hours per short piece
      - Sustainable: 2 pieces/week

      Don't plan for more.
      ```

      ### Sustainability Strategies

      **1. Batch Creation**
      - Dedicate blocks of time
      - Create multiple pieces at once
      - Reduces context switching

      **2. Repurposing**
      - 1 long piece → multiple short pieces
      - Same idea, different formats
      - Leverage existing work

      **3. Curation**
      - Share others' work with commentary
      - Less creation, still value
      - Builds relationships

      **4. Collaboration**
      - Guest posts
      - Interviews
      - Co-creation

      ### Burnout Prevention

      | Warning Sign | Response |
      |--------------|----------|
      | Dreading creation | Reduce frequency |
      | Quality declining | Take a break |
      | No new ideas | Consume more, create less |
      | Feeling performative | Reconnect with why |

      ### Minimum Viable Consistency

      ```
      Better than stopping:
      - Reduce frequency
      - Shorter content
      - Curation mode
      - Guest content

      Consistency > volume
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Falling behind on content
      - Quality declining
      - Resentment toward creating
    detection_pattern: "burnout|exhausted|can't keep up"

  - id: audience-of-peers-only
    summary: Only reaching other thought leaders
    severity: medium
    situation: Content gets likes from industry peers, not buyers
    why: |
      Peers don't buy your product.

      Misses actual target audience.
    solution: |
      ## Reaching Beyond Peers

      ### Audience Analysis

      ```
      Who engages with your content?
      - Other thought leaders?
      - Industry observers?
      - Actual practitioners?
      - Buyers/decision makers?

      Goal: Reach practitioners and buyers,
            not just peers.
      ```

      ### Content Adjustments

      | Peer-Focused | Practitioner-Focused |
      |--------------|----------------------|
      | Meta-commentary | How-to content |
      | Industry hot takes | Problem-solving |
      | Abstract frameworks | Concrete examples |

             Business inquiries
