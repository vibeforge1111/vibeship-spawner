    summary: Voice doesn't match brand, message, or audience
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Selected voice talent or AI voice doesn't fit the brand personality,
      message tone, or target audience expectations. Professional voice
      that feels off-brand. Casual voice for serious content. Young voice
      for mature audience.
    why: |
      Wrong voice undermines the entire video. Viewers subconsciously
      judge credibility and brand fit within seconds. A mismatch creates
      cognitive dissonance—they're thinking about why the voice feels wrong
      instead of absorbing the message. Voice is half the video experience.
    solution: |
      VOICE MATCHING PROCESS:

      DEFINE REQUIREMENTS FIRST:
      - Brand personality (professional, friendly, edgy, warm)
      - Message tone (serious, exciting, educational, urgent)
      - Audience expectations (who they trust)
      - Content type (ad, explainer, training)

      CASTING MATRIX:
      1. Gender appropriate for message
      2. Age range matches audience or authority need
      3. Tone matches brand voice guidelines
      4. Pace appropriate for content type
      5. Accent neutral or strategically chosen

      AUDITION PROCESS:
      - Request 3-5 sample reads
      - Test with actual script excerpt
      - Get feedback from target audience sample
      - Compare against competitors (differentiate)

      # Wrong voice = wasted video
    symptoms:
      - "Something feels off"
      - Audience feedback about voice
      - Lower engagement than expected
      - Brand disconnect

  - id: script-not-speakable
    summary: Script written for reading, not speaking
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Voiceover script contains language that works on paper but sounds
      unnatural when spoken. Long sentences, complex clauses, written-style
      phrasing, tongue-twisters, awkward word combinations.
    why: |
      Written language and spoken language are different. What reads well
      may not speak well. Complex sentences become confusing. Written
      contractions sound different than spoken ones. The talent struggles,
      multiple takes are needed, and the result still sounds off.
    solution: |
      SCRIPT SPEAKABILITY CHECK:

      READ ALOUD TEST:
      - Read every script out loud before recording
      - If you stumble, rewrite that section
      - If you run out of breath, shorten sentence

      CONVERSIONS:
      - Long sentences → Short sentences
      - Passive voice → Active voice
      - Written numbers → Spoken ("47" → "forty-seven")
      - Abbreviations → Full words or pronunciation
      - Complex words → Simple alternatives

      MARKS AND GUIDES:
      - Add breath marks: / for pause, || for longer
      - Add emphasis: *important word* or CAPS
      - Pronunciation: (pro-NUN-see-AY-shun)
      - Speed notes: [slow] or [faster]

      # If it's hard to say, rewrite it
    symptoms:
      - Talent struggles with lines
      - Multiple takes for simple sentences
      - Unnatural sounding delivery
      - "Can I say this differently?"

  - id: audio-quality-issues
    summary: Poor recording quality undermines professional content
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Voiceover audio has quality issues: background noise, echo/reverb,
      inconsistent levels, mouth sounds, sibilance, clipping, or generally
      "bedroom quality" sound on professional content.
    why: |
      Audio quality is non-negotiable. Bad audio immediately signals amateur
      production, regardless of how good the video looks. Viewers may not
      consciously notice good audio, but they absolutely notice bad audio.
      It destroys credibility and professional perception.
    solution: |
      AUDIO QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:

      TECHNICAL SPECS:
      - Format: WAV, 24-bit, 48kHz minimum
      - Noise floor: Below -60dB
      - Peak levels: -6dB to -3dB
      - No clipping or distortion

      RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:
      - Treated room or professional booth
      - No background noise (AC, traffic, etc.)
      - Minimal reverb/echo
      - Consistent room tone

      TALENT REQUIREMENTS:
      - Professional microphone (not laptop mic)
      - Pop filter for plosives
      - Proper mic technique
      - Room tone recording

      POST-PROCESSING:
      - Noise reduction (subtle)
      - De-essing if needed
      - Compression for consistency
      - EQ for clarity

      REMOTE RECORDING:
      - Require professional home studio OR
      - Rent local booth time

      # Never accept bad audio
    symptoms:
      - Audible background noise
      - Echo or room sound
      - Inconsistent volume
      - Harsh or muffled sound

  - id: ai-voice-uncanny
    summary: AI-generated voice sounds robotic or unnatural
    severity: high
    situation: |
      AI voice is used without proper settings adjustment or review.
      Result sounds clearly artificial—wrong emphasis, unnatural pauses,
      mispronunciations, or the subtle "AI quality" that audiences
      now recognize.
    why: |
      AI voices have improved dramatically but still have tells. Audiences
      increasingly recognize AI voices and some perceive them negatively
      for brand content. Uncanny valley effect can undermine message.
      AI without human review often has subtle errors.
    solution: |
      AI VOICE BEST PRACTICES:

      WHEN AI IS APPROPRIATE:
      - High-volume content
      - Frequently updated content
      - Internal/training content
      - Prototyping
      - Budget constraints

      WHEN AI IS NOT:
      - Hero brand content
      - High-stakes customer-facing
      - Emotional narratives
      - Content that lives for years

      OPTIMIZATION:
      - Adjust pace and pause settings
      - Test multiple voice options
      - Add custom pronunciations
      - Break long sentences
      - Review every output (no auto-publish)

      HYBRID APPROACH:
      - AI for volume/variations
      - Human for flagship content
      - AI prototype → human final

      # AI is a tool, not autopilot
    symptoms:
      - "Sounds like a robot"
      - Mispronunciations
      - Wrong emphasis
      - Audience distrust

  - id: poor-direction
    summary: Voice talent not properly directed
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Recording session produces technically clean audio but wrong
      performance. Talent doesn't understand the context, tone, or
      intent. Direction given in mechanical terms ("say it slower")
      rather than emotional terms ("make it feel like a secret").
    why: |
      Voice actors are performers, not playback machines. Without proper
      context and direction, even great talent delivers generic reads.
      The performance carries the emotional content—wrong performance
      means wrong emotional impact, regardless of script quality.
    solution: |
      DIRECTION FRAMEWORK:

      PRE-SESSION:
      - Share script 24+ hours ahead
      - Provide brand/audience context
      - Include reference audio if available
      - Explain the "why" of the video

      DIRECTION LANGUAGE:
      - Use feelings, not mechanics
      - Bad: "Read that word slower"
      - Good: "This line is a secret you're sharing"
      - Bad: "More energy"
      - Good: "Like you just discovered something amazing"

      SESSION FLOW:
      1. Full read-through first (warmup)
      2. Section-by-section direction
      3. 3 takes minimum per section
      4. Vary energy across takes
      5. Record wild takes (let them play)

      HELPFUL PHRASES:
      - "Like you're talking to a friend"
      - "More smile in your voice"
      - "This is the key point—land it"
      - "Throw it away" (less emphasis)

      # Direct the performance, not just the words
    symptoms:
      - Generic, flat delivery
      - Talent asking "like this?"
      - Multiple takes same quality
      - Missing emotional nuance
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: pacing-problems
    summary: Voiceover pacing doesn't match content needs
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Voiceover is too fast (information overload), too slow (boring),
      or pacing doesn't match the visual content it accompanies. Viewers
      can't absorb information or lose interest. Audio and visual feel
      disconnected.
    why: |
      Pacing controls comprehension and emotion. Too fast and viewers miss
      information. Too slow and they disengage. Mismatched pacing between
      audio and visual creates cognitive friction. Viewers shouldn't have
      to work to follow along.
    solution: |
      PACING GUIDELINES:

      GENERAL RATES:
      - Slow (serious/important): 130 words/min
      - Conversational: 150 words/min
      - Energetic: 170 words/min
      - Fast (urgency): 180+ words/min

      DURATION GUIDES:
      - 6 seconds: ~15 words max
      - 15 seconds: ~40 words max
      - 30 seconds: ~75 words max
      - 60 seconds: ~150 words max

      MATCHING VISUALS:
      - Pause for visual transitions
      - Speed up during fast cuts
      - Slow down for key visuals
      - Sync emphasis with visual focus

      VARIATION:
      - Vary pace within same read
      - Slow for key points
      - Speed through transitions
      - Pause for impact

      # Pacing serves comprehension
    symptoms:
      - Viewers rewind/replay
      - Comments about speed
      - Audio-visual disconnect
      - Information not retained

  - id: single-take-syndrome
    summary: Not recording enough takes for editing options
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Recording only one take per section to save time or budget.
      No options in editing. If any issue discovered later, requires
      expensive re-recording. Missing the best possible performance.
    why: |
      Best performances often come on take 3-5. First take is warmup,
      last take is tired, middle is gold. Without options, you're stuck
      with whatever you got. Small issues become unfixable. Quality
      suffers because you can't choose the best moments.
    solution: |
      TAKE REQUIREMENTS:

      MINIMUM TAKES:
      - 3 takes of each section
      - Different energy/approach each
      - At least one "safe" take
      - At least one "play" take

      VARIATION TYPES:
      - Take 1: As scripted (safe)
      - Take 2: More energy
      - Take 3: Pulled back/intimate
      - Wild take: Improvise if appropriate

      RECORDING APPROACH:
      - Don't stop for small errors
      - Pick up and continue
      - Note take preferences live
      - Record entire script, then sections

      EDITING FREEDOM:
      - Choose best moment from any take
      - Comp together ideal read
      - Fix pacing in edit
      - Have backup options

      # Multiple takes = editing freedom
    symptoms:
      - Stuck with flawed takes
      - No editing options
      - Expensive re-records
      - Compromise on quality

  - id: ignoring-timing
    summary: Voiceover doesn't sync with video timing requirements
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Voiceover recorded without awareness of video timing. Script is
      too long or short for video. VO finishes before visual sequence
      or visuals wait for VO. Awkward gaps or overlaps.
    why: |
      Voiceover and video must work together. When timing is off, the
      experience feels amateur. Either you rush visuals to match VO,
      cut VO to match visuals (often awkwardly), or live with mismatch.
      All options are worse than planning ahead.
    solution: |
      TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION:

      PRE-RECORDING:
      - Time the animatic/rough cut
      - Adjust script to match
      - Note required pauses
      - Mark sync points

      SCRIPT TIMING:
      - Read script at intended pace
      - Add 10-20% buffer
      - Mark natural pause points
      - Align with visual transitions

      RECORDING:
      - Record to picture if possible
      - Or record with timing reference
      - Note intended sync points
      - Get takes at different speeds

      POST-RECORDING:
      - Time-stretch carefully (max 10%)
      - Cut breaths for tightening
      - Add pauses for slowing
      - Re-record if significantly off

      # Plan timing before recording
    symptoms:
      - VO too long/short
      - Awkward gaps
      - Rushed visuals
      - Cut-up voiceover

  - id: consistency-issues
    summary: Voice quality varies across project or series
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Multiple recording sessions produce inconsistent audio quality
      or performance style. Different energy levels, room tone, or
      technical quality between sessions. Series content sounds like
      different productions.
    why: |
      Consistency builds brand recognition and professional perception.
      Inconsistent audio signals inconsistent quality. Viewers notice
      when something changes—even subconsciously. Series or campaign
      content should feel unified.
    solution: |
      CONSISTENCY CONTROLS:

      SAME TALENT:
      - Book talent for full project
      - Record all related content together
      - Reference previous recordings

      SAME SETUP:
      - Document equipment settings
      - Same mic, same position
      - Same room/booth
      - Reference recordings

      SAME DIRECTION:
      - Style guide for voice
      - Reference clips for tone
      - Same director/producer

      QUALITY MATCHING:
      - Match levels across recordings
      - Match EQ/processing
      - A/B test with previous content

      # Consistency = professionalism
    symptoms:
      - Different "sound" between videos
      - Varying energy levels
      - Audience notices changes
      - Series feels disjointed
