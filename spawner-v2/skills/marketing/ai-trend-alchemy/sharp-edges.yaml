    summary: Feeling compelled to respond to every trending topic
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Treating every trending topic as an opportunity, exhausting the team
      and diluting the brand by attempting to ride every wave.
    why: |
      Most trend responses are mediocre. The team burns out. The brand looks
      desperate. One great trend execution is worth ten forgettable ones.
      Selective excellence builds reputation; trend addiction destroys it.
    solution: |
      TREND SELECTION FRAMEWORK:

      MUST HAVE ALL FIVE:
      □ Natural brand connection (not forced)
      □ Audience relevance (they care)
      □ Time to execute well (not rushed)
      □ Unique angle to add (not derivative)
      □ No sensitivity concerns (safe)

      IF ANY IS MISSING → SKIP

      WEEKLY QUOTA:
      - Maximum 2-3 trend responses per week
      - Quality > quantity, always
      - Permission to skip is valid
      - \'"Not our moment" is professional
\'
      PRIORITIZATION:
      Tier 1: Perfect fit + high impact → Full effort
      Tier 2: Good fit + medium impact → Quick execution
      Tier 3: Marginal fit → Skip

      # Selective excellence > exhaustive mediocrity
    symptoms:
      - Team burnout
      - Declining content quality
      - Forced, awkward connections
      - Diminishing returns on effort

  - id: analysis-paralysis
    summary: Over-analyzing trends until they pass
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Spending so long analyzing whether to pursue a trend that the trend
      peaks and declines before any content is created.
    why: |
      Trends have short windows. Over-analysis is choosing to miss the moment.
      The cost of a wrong trend choice is low; the cost of consistent slowness
      is high. You need a quick decision framework, not perfect analysis.
    solution: |
      RAPID DECISION FRAMEWORK:

      30-MINUTE DECISION PROCESS:
      1. Brand fit? (Y/N - 5 min)
      2. Sensitivity clear? (Y/N - 5 min)
      3. Can we execute in time? (Y/N - 5 min)
      4. Unique angle exists? (Y/N - 10 min)
      5. GO or NO-GO decision (5 min)

      DECISION RULES:
      - If all yes → GO immediately
      - If any clear no → SKIP immediately
      - If uncertain on one → Get one second opinion, then decide
      - Never "let's think about it more"

      SPEED OVER PERFECTION:
      - 80% right decision now > 100% right decision too late
      - Missed trends hurt more than wrong trends
      - Build decision muscle through practice

      POST-DECISION:
      - If GO: execute immediately
      - If SKIP: move on, no regrets
      - Don't revisit decision

      # Decide fast. Act faster.
    symptoms:
      - Consistently missing trend windows
      - \'"We should have done that" regrets\'
      - Long meetings about trends
      - Paralyzed by uncertainty

  - id: forced-brand-connection
    summary: Shoehorning brand into trends that don't naturally fit
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Forcing brand into trending conversations where there's no organic
      connection, making the brand look desperate or out of touch.
    why: |
      Audiences immediately sense forced connections. "What does [brand]
      have to do with this?" kills the content. Cringe is worse than silence.
      The connection needs to feel obvious, not explained.
    solution: |
      NATURAL FIT TEST:

      ASK THESE QUESTIONS:
      1. Can I explain the connection in one sentence?
      2. Would a stranger understand why we're here?
      3. Does this feel like us?
      4. Are we adding value or just extracting attention?
      5. Would our audience expect us here?

      IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION:
      → It's forced. Skip it.

      GOOD FIT INDICATORS:
      - Connection is immediately obvious
      - You'd be surprised if brand DIDN'T comment
      - Brand has genuine expertise/standing
      - Content provides value beyond brand plug

      BAD FIT INDICATORS:
      - Requires explanation
      - "Well, if you think about it..."
      - Primarily about being seen
      - No value added to conversation

      PERMISSION TO SKIP:
      "This isn't our trend" is a professional decision.
      Wait for a trend that actually fits.

      # If it's forced, everyone knows
    symptoms:
      - \'"Why is [brand] here?" comments\'
      - Low engagement despite trend traffic
      - Cringe perception
      - Brand reputation damage

  - id: late-to-party
    summary: Publishing trend content after the moment has passed
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Completing content creation after trend has peaked, publishing when
      the moment is stale. Being the last brand to comment on something.
    why: |
      Late trend content is worse than no content. Shows you're trying to
      be relevant but failing. Screams "we're slow." Better to skip entirely
      than to be visibly late.
    solution: |
      TIMING RULES:

      HOT MOMENTS (2-6 hour window):
      - Viral memes
      - Breaking culture moments
      - Surprise announcements
      → If you can't publish within window, SKIP

      WARM MOMENTS (same day):
      - Planned events (awards, sports)
      - Anticipated announcements
      - Scheduled cultural moments
      → Take your time if angle is unique

      COLD MOMENTS (1+ day):
      - Only if adding significant value
      - Contrarian/different perspective
      - Deep analysis vs quick take
      → Usually better to skip

      TIMING CHECK:
      Before starting: "Will this still be relevant when we finish?"
      If uncertain → Don't start

      MID-CREATION CHECK:
      If too slow → Kill it, move on
      Don't ship stale content

      # Late is worse than absent
    symptoms:
      - \'"This is so yesterday" reactions\'
      - Low engagement despite effort
      - Out of touch perception
      - Wasted team effort

  - id: context-blindness
    summary: Jumping on trends without understanding broader context
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Responding to trending topic without checking what's happening around
      it—connected tragedies, controversies, or sensitive associations.
    why: |
      Trends often connect to broader events. A meme might emerge from tragedy.
      A phrase might have political implications. Missing context leads to
      PR disasters that overshadow years of good marketing.
    solution: |
      CONTEXT CHECK PROTOCOL:

      BEFORE ANY TREND RESPONSE:
      □ What's in the news right now?
      □ What's the origin of this trend?
      □ Are there tragedy/crisis connections?
      □ Are there political/controversy links?
      □ Who's upset about this trend?
      □ What's the worst interpretation?

      RED FLAG TOPICS:
      - Active violence or tragedy
      - Political controversies
      - Cultural appropriation concerns
      - Health crises
      - Natural disasters
      - Celebrity death

      RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:
      - Check news for related events
      - Search for trend + "controversy"
      - Look at critical responses
      - Check multiple perspectives

      WHEN UNCERTAIN:
      - Get second opinion
      - When in doubt, don't
      - 5 minutes of research > brand crisis

      # Context is not optional
    symptoms:
      - \'"Read the room" criticism\'
      - Unexpected backlash
      - Crisis management activation
      - Brand apology required

  - id: derivative-response
    summary: Copying how competitors responded to a trend
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Seeing competitor's trend response and replicating their approach
      rather than finding a unique angle that fits your brand.
    why: |
      Second-to-market with the same idea = derivative and forgettable.
      Audiences notice copycat behavior. If you can't add something unique,
      you're just adding to noise.
    solution: |
      DIFFERENTIATION FRAMEWORK:

      IF COMPETITOR WENT FIRST:
      1. Can we do the opposite/contrarian take?
      2. Can we add unique expertise?
      3. Can we go deeper/longer-form?
      4. Can we address a different audience?
      5. Is there an uncovered angle?

      IF NO UNIQUE ANGLE EXISTS:
      → Skip this trend. Wait for next one.

      YOUR DIFFERENTIATORS:
      - Brand voice (HOW you say it)
      - Brand expertise (WHAT you know)
      - Brand assets (WHAT you have)
      - Brand community (WHO you reach)

      USE YOUR DIFFERENTIATORS:
      - What can only we say?
      - What perspective is ours alone?
      - How would we naturally respond?
      - Not: How should a brand respond?

      # Unique angle or skip
    symptoms:
      - "They did what [competitor] did"
      - Lower engagement than competitor
      - Derivative brand perception
      - Missed uniqueness opportunity

  - id: prediction-without-execution
    summary: Detecting trends early but failing to act on them
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Successfully identifying emerging trends before they peak, but not
      having systems to generate content fast enough to capitalize.
    why: |
      Detection without execution is just interesting data. Knowing a trend
      is coming means nothing if you can't be ready when it arrives. The
      prediction system must connect to a rapid execution system.
    solution: |
      PREDICTION-TO-EXECUTION PIPELINE:

      PREDICTION OUTPUT:
      - Not just "this is trending"
      - Include: likely peak timing
      - Include: brand relevance score
      - Include: recommended angle
      - Include: content brief

      EXECUTION READINESS:
      - Pre-approved templates
      - Brand asset library
      - Rapid approval workflow
      - AI generation ready
      - Team on standby for key moments

      TRIGGER SYSTEM:
      - When prediction confidence > threshold
      - Automatically alert content team
      - Include all needed context
      - Clear go/no-go deadline

      PRACTICE RUNS:
      - Regularly drill rapid response
      - Time from signal to publish
      - Identify bottlenecks
      - Improve execution speed

      # Detection + Execution = Value
    symptoms:
      - "We saw it coming but..."
      - Analysis reports with no action
      - Prediction team frustrated
      - Competitors execute on your insights

  - id: trend-creation-hubris
    summary: Overestimating ability to manufacture trends
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Believing brand can create trends at will, without the reach, timing,
      or cultural resonance required for viral success.
    why: |
      Most manufactured trends fail. Organic trends have natural advantages.
      Trend creation requires significant reach, perfect timing, and genuine
      cultural resonance. It's hard, and overconfidence leads to wasted resources.
    solution: |
      TREND CREATION REALITY CHECK:

      REQUIREMENTS FOR TREND CREATION:
      - Significant existing reach (millions)
      - Perfect timing with cultural moment
      - Genuinely resonant hook
      - Replicable, participatory format
      - Seeding network of creators
      - AND luck

      SUCCESS RATE:
      - Most attempts fail
      - Even with all requirements
      - Don't bet the quarter on it
      - Treat as bonus, not strategy

      BETTER APPROACH:
      - Trend riding > trend creation
      - Build capability to respond fast
      - Let organic trends find you
      - Create when opportunity is perfect

      IF ATTEMPTING CREATION:
      - Small investment to test
      - Clear success metrics
      - Kill threshold defined
      - Learn from failures

      # Respect the difficulty
    symptoms:
      - Failed "viral" campaigns
      - Over-investment in trend creation
      - Team demoralized by failures
      - Expectation vs reality gap

  - id: signal-noise-confusion
    summary: Mistaking noise for real trend signals
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Seeing early movement in data and assuming it's a trend, when it's
      actually noise, temporary spike, or bot activity.
    why: |
      Not all spikes are trends. Bots can inflate metrics. Temporary events
      create false signals. Reacting to noise wastes resources and credibility.
      Need signal validation before investing in response.
    solution: |
      SIGNAL VALIDATION:

      MULTI-SOURCE CONFIRMATION:
      - Is it appearing in multiple places?
      - Organic social + search + communities?
      - Not just one platform or metric?

      VELOCITY CHECK:
      - Is it accelerating or one-time spike?
      - Sustained growth vs flash?
      - Trajectory suggests more to come?

      ORGANIC INDICATORS:
      - Real creators participating (not just brands)
      - Community discussion (Reddit, Discord)
      - User-generated content appearing
      - Not bot-like patterns

      BOT/MANIPULATION CHECK:
      - Suspicious account patterns
      - Coordinated timing
      - Copy-paste content
      - Unusual engagement ratios

      WAIT THRESHOLD:
      - For unclear signals, wait 2-4 hours
      - Check if pattern sustains
      - Better to be slightly late than wrong

      # Validate before acting
    symptoms:
      - Responding to non-trends
      - Wasted content creation
      - \'"Why did we do that?" retrospectives\'
      - Lost credibility for false predictions

  - id: cultural-appropriation-risk
    summary: Participating in trends from cultures you don't belong to
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Joining trends that originate from specific cultural communities when
      brand has no connection to those communities.
    why: |
      Cultural trends often belong to the communities that create them. Brands
      jumping in without standing can be seen as appropriation. What's playful
      for community members can be offensive from outsiders.
    solution: |
      CULTURAL STANDING CHECK:

      BEFORE PARTICIPATING:
      □ What community does this trend come from?
      □ Is it specific to a cultural group?
      □ Does our brand have connection/standing?
      □ Would our participation be welcome?
      □ Are we amplifying or extracting?

      HIGH RISK SCENARIOS:
      - AAVE/Black cultural expressions
      - Religious or spiritual references
      - Indigenous cultural elements
      - Specific community in-jokes
      - Music/dance from specific cultures

      APPROPRIATE ACTIONS:
      - Amplify original creators (with credit)
      - Stay in your lane
      - Celebrate without appropriating
      - When in doubt, appreciate from distance

      IF UNCERTAIN:
      - Ask someone from the community
      - Research the origin
      - Err on side of not participating
      - Find trends you have standing for

      # Respect cultural boundaries
    symptoms:
      - \'"Stay in your lane" criticism\'
      - Appropriation accusations
      - Community backlash
      - Brand reputation damage
