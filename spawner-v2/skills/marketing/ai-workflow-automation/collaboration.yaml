# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Software Engineering (CI/CD)
    insight: |
      CI/CD pipelines teach workflow automation:
      - Build → Test → Deploy stages (like Content → QA → Publish)
      - Quality gates prevent bad code shipping (like content quality gates)
      - Automated testing reduces human review (like automated checks)
      - Rollback on failure (like reverting bad content)
      - Monitoring and alerts (like workflow health dashboards)

      Marketing automation is content CI/CD.
    applies_when: "Designing content pipelines and quality gates"

  - domain: Manufacturing (Lean Production)
    insight: |
      Lean manufacturing principles apply to content:
      - Eliminate waste (automate repetitive tasks)
      - Continuous improvement (optimize workflows over time)
      - Just-in-time production (generate when needed, not in advance)
      - Quality at the source (gates prevent defects flowing downstream)
      - Visual management (dashboards show workflow health)

      Content automation benefits from manufacturing rigor.
    applies_when: "Optimizing workflow efficiency and quality"

  - domain: Operations (SRE/DevOps)
    insight: |
      Site Reliability Engineering teaches automation resilience:
      - SLOs (Service Level Objectives) → Workflow SLAs
      - Error budgets → Acceptable failure rates
      - Monitoring and alerting → Workflow health tracking
      - Incident response → Workflow failure handling
      - Blameless postmortems → Learning from automation failures

      Treat content workflows like production systems.
    applies_when: "Building reliable, scalable workflows"

  - domain: Finance (Risk Management)
    insight: |
      Financial risk management applies to automation:
      - Portfolio diversification → Don't rely on one AI model
      - Stop-loss limits → Cost budget hard stops
      - Stress testing → Test workflows under failure scenarios
      - Audit trails → Log all decisions and actions
      - Regulatory compliance → Brand/legal compliance gates

      Automation has financial and reputational risk.
    applies_when: "Managing costs and risks in automation"

  - domain: Aviation (Checklists and Redundancy)
    insight: |
      Aviation safety teaches automation reliability:
      - Pre-flight checklists → Quality gate checklists
      - Redundant systems → Backup approvers, fallback integrations
      - Black box logging → Comprehensive workflow logs
      - Go/no-go decisions → Automated proceed/halt logic
      - Crew resource management → Human-AI collaboration

      High-stakes automation requires aviation-grade reliability.
    applies_when: "Designing fail-safe automation systems"

  notes: |
    Workflow automation is a rapidly evolving space.
    Key considerations:
    - AI APIs update frequently (track model versions)
    - Automation platforms add features regularly
    - Integration APIs change (version lock when possible)
    - Cost structures evolve (monitor pricing changes)

    Best practices:
    - Version control workflow configurations
    - Test workflows in staging before production
    - Monitor for API deprecations
    - Have rollback plans for breaking changes

    Current as of December 2024. Check vendor docs for latest.
