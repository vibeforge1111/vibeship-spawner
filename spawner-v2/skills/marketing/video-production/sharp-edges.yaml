    summary: Starting production without written, approved script
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Team eager to start filming. Camera equipment rented. Talent booked.
      But script isn't finalized or hasn't been approved. "We'll figure it out
      on set" mentality. Thinking the video can be "saved in post."
    why: |
      Without a script, you're paying to improvise. Every minute on set costs
      money—crew, equipment, talent, location. Unclear messaging leads to
      multiple takes, wasted footage, and editing nightmares. The resulting
      video often requires reshoots or, worse, delivers a muddled message.
      The script is the blueprint; building without one means expensive changes.
    solution: |
      SCRIPT-FIRST PRODUCTION:

      NON-NEGOTIABLE STEPS:
      1. Write complete script before any production
      2. Get stakeholder approval (in writing)
      3. Table read with talent before shoot day
      4. Lock script 48+ hours before production
      5. Any changes = formal change request

      SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
      - Every spoken word written
      - Shot descriptions noted
      - Timing estimates per section
      - B-roll requirements listed
      - Props/graphics called out

      APPROVAL CHECKLIST:
      [ ] Message is clear
      [ ] Tone is on-brand
      [ ] Length is appropriate
      [ ] All stakeholders signed off
      [ ] Changes are frozen

      # No script, no shoot
    symptoms:
      - "We'll figure it out on set"
      - Multiple script revisions during shoot
      - Talent asking "what should I say?"
      - Post-production message problems

  - id: audio-neglect
    summary: Treating audio as secondary to video quality
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Beautiful footage captured with great lighting and composition. But
      audio is noisy, inconsistent, or unintelligible. Using on-camera
      microphone instead of dedicated audio. No audio monitoring during
      recording. "We'll fix it in post" mentality.
    why: |
      Viewers will forgive subpar video but abandon unwatchable audio. Bad
      audio—echo, noise, inconsistent levels—signals amateur production
      regardless of how good the visuals look. Audio is literally half the
      video experience. Once recorded poorly, it cannot be fully recovered.
      Post-processing can help but can't resurrect fundamentally bad audio.
    solution: |
      AUDIO-FIRST CHECKLIST:

      EQUIPMENT:
      - Lavalier mic for interviews
      - Shotgun mic for action
      - Audio recorder (backup to camera)
      - Headphones for monitoring (ALWAYS)

      ENVIRONMENT:
      - Check room for noise (AC, traffic, electronics)
      - Sound treatment if needed
      - Record room tone (30 sec of silence)

      RECORDING:
      - Monitor audio during recording
      - Check levels before starting
      - Use -12dB to -6dB target
      - Record backup audio

      POST-PRODUCTION:
      - Noise reduction (subtle)
      - Compression for consistency
      - EQ for clarity
      - Match levels across cuts

      # Audio is half the experience
    symptoms:
      - Audible background noise
      - Echo or reverb
      - Inconsistent volume between shots
      - "We'll clean it up in post"

  - id: no-shot-list
    summary: Arriving on set without a detailed shot list
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Director has a vision but no documented shot list. Relying on memory
      and improvisation on set. Time wasted figuring out what to shoot next.
      Essential shots forgotten until editing phase. B-roll afterthought.
    why: |
      Sets are expensive and time-limited. Without a shot list, you waste time
      deciding what to shoot and inevitably miss critical shots. You can't
      shoot more in post-production. Editors need options, and forgotten
      shots mean compromised final product or expensive additional shoot days.
    solution: |
      SHOT LIST TEMPLATE:

      FOR EACH SCENE:
      - Shot number (for reference)
      - Shot type (wide/medium/close)
      - Description (what's in frame)
      - Action (what happens)
      - Audio (dialogue, nat sound)
      - Duration estimate
      - Notes (special requirements)

      CATEGORIES TO INCLUDE:
      1. Primary footage (main content)
      2. B-roll (supporting visuals)
      3. Establishing shots (context)
      4. Detail shots (close-ups)
      5. Safety shots (coverage)

      ON-SET TRACKING:
      [ ] Check off as completed
      [ ] Note best takes
      [ ] Add spontaneous additions
      [ ] Review before wrap

      # You can't shoot more in post
    symptoms:
      - Time wasted deciding shots on set
      - Missing essential footage in editing
      - Expensive additional shoot days
      - "I wish we had..."

  - id: one-take-mentality
    summary: Recording only one take to save time
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Time pressure on set. Single take seems "good enough." Moving on
      quickly to cover more ground. No variation in performance or camera
      angles. Best take is whatever you got.
    why: |
      Best performances rarely come on take one. First take is warmup, last
      take is tired, gold is in the middle. Without options, editors are
      stuck with whatever you recorded—including subtle issues that only
      become apparent in editing. Multiple takes are your insurance policy.
    solution: |
      TAKE REQUIREMENTS:

      MINIMUM TAKES:
      - 3 takes per setup (minimum)
      - 5 takes for critical lines
      - Vary energy across takes

      VARIATION TYPES:
      - Take 1: As scripted (safe)
      - Take 2: More energy
      - Take 3: Pulled back/intimate
      - Take 4-5: Wild takes (let talent play)

      TAKE NOTES:
      - Mark best takes immediately
      - Note issues on specific takes
      - Record take number on camera

      WORKFLOW:
      - Don't stop for small errors
      - Pick up and continue
      - Get complete takes when possible

      # Multiple takes = editing freedom
    symptoms:
      - Stuck with flawed takes
      - No editing options
      - Performance issues can't be fixed
      - "This is all we have"

  - id: color-before-edit-lock
    summary: Color grading before the edit is finalized
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Editor starts color grading while still making edit changes. Beautiful
      color work done on shots that later get cut. Timing changes invalidate
      color choices. Color becomes bottleneck for edit revisions.
    why: |
      Color grading takes significant time per shot. If the edit isn't locked,
      color work may be wasted on cut footage, and timing changes affect
      color choices (a fast montage has different color needs than a slow
      sequence). Color is one of the final steps for a reason.
    solution: |
      POST-PRODUCTION ORDER:

      1. ROUGH CUT
         - Assembly edit
         - Story structure
         - Timing decisions

      2. FINE CUT
         - Audio polish
         - Timing refinement
         - Music selection

      3. PICTURE LOCK
         - Client approval
         - No more edit changes
         - Final timing

      4. COLOR GRADE (only after lock)
         - Primary correction
         - Secondary/creative grade
         - Shot matching

      5. FINAL MIX
         - Audio sweetening
         - Music ducking
         - Final levels

      EXCEPTION: Basic correction during edit for visibility
      but not final creative grade.

      # Lock edit, then color
    symptoms:
      - Color work wasted on cut footage
      - Re-grading due to timing changes
      - Color becoming edit bottleneck
      - Inconsistent look

  - id: ignoring-platform-specs
    summary: Creating one video and resizing for all platforms
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Single video exported and cropped/letterboxed for different platforms.
      Square video cropped from 16:9 footage. Vertical video letterboxed
      for landscape. Text and faces cut off in reformatted versions.
    why: |
      Each platform has different aspect ratios, and audiences have different
      expectations. Cropped videos look amateur and lose important content.
      Platform algorithms may also penalize improperly formatted content.
      The extra production work pays off in performance.
    solution: |
      MULTI-PLATFORM PRODUCTION:

      PLAN IN PRE-PRODUCTION:
      - Know all delivery formats needed
      - Frame shots for multiple crops
      - Plan graphics placement for all formats

      COMMON FORMATS:
      - 16:9 (YouTube, website, horizontal)
      - 9:16 (TikTok, Reels, Shorts, vertical)
      - 1:1 (Instagram feed, square)
      - 4:5 (LinkedIn, Facebook feed)

      SHOOTING STRATEGY:
      - Shoot wide enough for vertical crop
      - Keep important action in center
      - Consider text/graphics safe zones

      POST-PRODUCTION:
      - Create master edit first
      - Reframe for each format
      - Adjust graphics per format
      - Export native versions

      # Plan for all formats from the start
    symptoms:
      - Letterboxed videos on vertical platforms
      - Cropped faces and text
      - Lower engagement on reformatted content
      - Amateur appearance

  - id: no-audio-sync
    summary: Video and audio recorded separately without sync strategy
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Audio recorded on separate device from video. No slate or sync point.
      Audio and video drift over time. Hours of footage to manually sync.
      Sync errors discovered too late.
    why: |
      Separate audio and video that can't be easily synced is a nightmare.
      Manual syncing is time-consuming and error-prone. Audio drift means
      some portions may be unusable. The few seconds to create sync points
      saves hours in post-production.
    solution: |
      AUDIO SYNC STRATEGY:

      SYNC METHODS:
      1. Slate/clapper (visual + audio spike)
      2. Handclap (backup sync point)
      3. Timecode (professional)
      4. Camera audio (reference track)

      WORKFLOW:
      - Record camera audio as backup/reference
      - Slate at start of each take
      - Clap hands if no slate available
      - Note take numbers on both devices

      POST-PRODUCTION:
      - Use auto-sync software (PluralEyes, Premiere)
      - Verify sync visually
      - Check for drift on long takes

      PREVENTION:
      - Same frame rate on all devices
      - Same sample rate on all audio
      - Battery-powered devices fully charged

      # Always create sync points
    symptoms:
      - Hours spent manually syncing
      - Audio drift on long takes
      - Unusable footage
      - Mismatched audio/video

  - id: missing-release-forms
    summary: Using footage of people without proper releases
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Talent or bystanders appear in footage. No release forms signed.
      People assumed to be okay with being filmed. Verbal agreements only.
      Releases collected inconsistently.
    why: |
      Without signed releases, you don't have legal right to use the footage.
      This can result in expensive re-shoots, legal challenges, or content
      that can't be published. Verbal agreements are difficult to enforce.
      The few minutes to collect releases prevents major problems.
    solution: |
      RELEASE MANAGEMENT:

      ALWAYS GET SIGNED RELEASES:
      - All on-camera talent
      - Anyone identifiable in footage
      - Minors require guardian signature
      - Property owners (if private property)

      RELEASE SHOULD INCLUDE:
      - Perpetual, worldwide usage rights
      - All media formats
      - Promotional usage
      - Ability to edit/modify

      WORKFLOW:
      - Collect before filming starts
      - Digital signatures acceptable
      - Keep organized by project
      - Verify against footage

      EXCEPTIONS:
      - Public spaces (varies by jurisdiction)
      - News/documentary (fair use)
      - Incidental appearance (blur if needed)

      # No release = no footage
    symptoms:
      - Footage can't be published
      - Legal challenges
      - Re-shoots required
      - "They said it was fine"

  - id: insufficient-storage
    summary: Running out of storage during production
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Cards fill up during shoot. No backup cards available. Deleting footage
      on set to make room. Stopping production to transfer files.
      Not enough backup drives.
    why: |
      Storage problems stop production and can result in lost footage.
      Deleting on set to make room risks losing valuable content. Video
      files are large—4K footage can consume 1GB per minute or more.
      Running out of storage is 100% preventable with preparation.
    solution: |
      STORAGE PLANNING:

      CAPACITY RULE:
      - Calculate: Duration × Bitrate × 2 (safety factor)
      - 4K ProRes: ~1GB/minute
      - 4K H.264: ~400MB/minute
      - 1080p: ~200MB/minute

      CARD STRATEGY:
      - Primary cards for each camera
      - Backup cards (2x capacity needed)
      - Labeled and organized
      - Never delete on set

      BACKUP WORKFLOW:
      - Transfer after each session
      - Two copies minimum
      - Verify transfer before formatting
      - Never format until verified

      LONG SHOOTS:
      - Dedicated DIT (data wrangler)
      - On-set backup drives
      - Transfer during breaks

      # Never run out of storage
    symptoms:
      - Production stops for transfers
      - Deleting footage to make room
      - Lost or corrupted footage
      - Storage anxiety on set
