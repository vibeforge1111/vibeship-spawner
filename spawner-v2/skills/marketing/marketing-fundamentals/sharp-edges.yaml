    summary: Spending on ads before validating message and channel
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Raised money. Marketing budget allocated. Running ads immediately.
      High CPA, low conversion, burning cash. Scaling what does not work.

      Real example: SaaS startup spent $80k on Facebook ads in 30 days.
      Got 2,000 clicks, 47 signups, 1 paid customer. $80k for one customer
      with $49/month LTV. Never recovered.
    why: |
      Paid acquisition amplifies what exists. If the message does not work
      organically, ads make it fail faster. Validate before scaling. Prove
      unit economics at small scale first.

      The brutal truth: If you can't get 10 customers through manual outreach,
      paid ads won't save you. They'll just burn money faster while teaching
      you nothing about why people don't want this.
    solution: |
      Paid acquisition readiness checklist:

      1. Can you acquire customers manually first? (10+ through outreach)
      2. Do you know exact target customer? (job title, pain, budget)
      3. Is message validated through conversations? (they repeat it back)
      4. Do unit economics work at small scale? (LTV > 3x CAC minimum)
      5. Have you tested organic first? (content, community, direct)

      If ANY answer is no, do not scale paid yet.

      Start with $500 test budget. If that doesn't work, $5,000 won't either.
    symptoms:
      - High CPA with low conversion
      - Scaling ad spend without profitability
      - No organic traction before ads
      - Message not validated
      - "We just need more volume" mentality

  - id: brand-before-traction
    summary: Investing in brand campaigns before product-market fit
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Building brand awareness with no product-market fit. Logo redesigns.
      Brand campaigns. Beautiful website. But customers do not convert because
      the product does not solve their problem yet.
    why: |
      Brand follows product, not the other way around. Strong brands are built
      on strong products. Investing in brand before PMF is painting a house
      with no foundation.
    solution: |
      Pre-PMF marketing focus:

      1. Direct response only (measurable, trackable)
      2. Customer conversations (learn their language)
      3. Channel testing (find what works)
      4. Message testing (find what converts)

      Brand investment comes after PMF proven.
    symptoms:
      - Brand campaigns without conversion tracking
      - Awareness focus pre-PMF
      - Beautiful brand, no customers
      - Marketing spend without metrics

  - id: channel-spray
    summary: Trying every channel superficially instead of mastering one
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Active on 8 social platforms. Running 4 ad channels. Posting everywhere.
      No channel actually working. Spreading effort thin. Same mediocre results
      on all channels.
    why: |
      Channels reward depth. Each channel has its own playbook. Mastering one
      channel beats being mediocre on ten. Most successful startups found ONE
      channel that worked and scaled it.
    solution: |
      Channel mastery approach:

      1. Pick 2-3 channels to test
      2. Run real tests with real budget
      3. Kill losers quickly
      4. Double down on winner
      5. Master before diversifying

      One channel at K=2 beats five channels at K=0.1.
    symptoms:
      - Many channels, none working
      - No clear winner after months
      - Budget spread thin
      - No channel expertise

  - id: competitor-copying
    summary: Copying competitor marketing without understanding context
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Competitor runs billboards. We should run billboards. Competitor does
      influencer marketing. We should too. Copying tactics without understanding
      why they work for them.
    why: |
      Competitor context is invisible. They might have different margins, different
      customers, different goals. What works for them may not work for you. Their
      visible tactics hide invisible strategy.
    solution: |
      Competitor analysis framework:

      Ask before copying:
      - Why does this work for them?
      - What is their cost structure?
      - Who is their customer vs ours?
      - What is their goal with this tactic?

      Understand before imitating.
    symptoms:
      - Copying without analysis
      - Same tactics as competitors
      - Not working like it does for them
      - Following industry playbook blindly

  - id: vanity-metrics-focus
    summary: Optimizing for impressions and clicks instead of revenue
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Dashboard shows millions of impressions. Thousands of clicks. Marketing
      team celebrates. Sales flat. Revenue unchanged. Vanity metrics up, business
      metrics static.
    why: |
      Impressions and clicks do not pay bills. They are leading indicators at best.
      Optimizing for vanity metrics feels good but does not grow business. Focus
      on metrics that matter.
    solution: |
      Metric hierarchy:

      Primary: Revenue, CAC, LTV
      Secondary: Qualified leads, conversion rates
      Tertiary: Traffic, engagement

      Optimize down the chain, not up. Revenue first.
    symptoms:
      - Celebrating impressions
      - Traffic up, revenue flat
      - No revenue attribution
      - Dashboard shows vanity metrics

  - id: message-market-mismatch
    summary: Using internal language instead of customer language
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Website copy sounds like product spec. Features listed with internal names.
      Benefits described in company terms. Customers do not understand. Conversion
      low despite good product.
    why: |
      Customers do not know your internal terms. They describe problems in their
      words. If your message does not match their language, they do not recognize
      you solve their problem.
    solution: |
      Customer language mining:

      1. Record customer conversations
      2. Note exact phrases they use
      3. Use their words in copy
      4. Test comprehension with new visitors

      Their language, not yours.
    symptoms:
      - Internal jargon in marketing
      - Feature-focused copy
      - Low comprehension scores
      - Customers confused by messaging

  - id: no-positioning
    summary: Marketing without clear positioning foundation
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Running campaigns. Trying messages. Nothing works consistently. Each campaign
      reinvents positioning. No clear answer to why this over alternatives.
    why: |
      Positioning is the foundation. Without it, marketing is random. Clear
      positioning answers: For whom? In what category? Why different? What proof?
      Without these answers, every campaign is a shot in the dark.
    solution: |
      Positioning work (before campaigns):

      1. Target customer: Who gets most value?
      2. Category: What mental bucket?
      3. Differentiation: Why this over alternatives?
      4. Proof: What evidence supports claims?

      Do this once. Use it everywhere.
    symptoms:
      - Different message every campaign
      - Cannot answer why this over competitors
      - No consistent positioning
      - Marketing feels random

  - id: launch-and-forget
    summary: Treating marketing as one-time launch instead of ongoing
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Big launch. PR push. Product Hunt. Then silence. No sustained marketing.
      Spike in traffic, then back to baseline. One-time event, not ongoing engine.
    why: |
      Launches are events. Marketing is an engine. The spike fades. Sustainable
      growth comes from ongoing effort. Build the machine, not just the event.
    solution: |
      Ongoing marketing engine:

      1. Content calendar (consistent publishing)
      2. Channel maintenance (regular posting)
      3. Campaign cadence (monthly themes)
      4. Measurement rhythm (weekly reviews)

      Launch is day one, not the whole plan.
    symptoms:
      - Traffic spike then decline
      - No post-launch plan
      - Marketing only at launches
      - No ongoing content

  - id: attribution-blindness
    summary: Not knowing which marketing efforts drive results
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Running multiple campaigns. Customers arriving. Cannot tell which campaign
      brought them. Making decisions without attribution data. Flying blind.
    why: |
      Without attribution, you cannot optimize. You might be doubling down on
      what does not work and cutting what does. Attribution enables learning.
    solution: |
      Basic attribution setup:

      1. UTM parameters on all links
      2. Conversion tracking in place
      3. Attribution window defined
      4. Regular reporting on source

      Know where customers come from.
    symptoms:
      - Cannot tell which campaigns work
      - No UTM discipline
      - Decisions without data
      - Spending without attribution

  - id: hiring-before-playbook
    summary: Hiring marketing team before knowing what works
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Raised money. Hire head of marketing. They ask what is working. Nothing
      yet. They experiment from scratch. Expensive experimentation. Should have
      found playbook first.
    why: |
      Hiring scales what works. If nothing works yet, you are paying senior salary
      for experimentation founders could do cheaper. Find the playbook, then hire
      to scale it.
    solution: |
      Marketing hiring sequence:

      1. Founder does marketing until something works
      2. Document the playbook
      3. Hire to scale the playbook
      4. Then hire to find new channels

      Playbook first, hire second.
    symptoms:
      - Marketing hire with no playbook
      - Expensive experimentation
      - Team without direction
      - No proven channel to scale
