  channels, and growth. Focus on what works for resource-constrained teams.

triggers:
  - marketing strategy
  - positioning
  - messaging
  - customer acquisition
  - growth channels
  - brand
  - go-to-market

principles:
  - name: Positioning First
    description: |
      Before tactics, nail positioning. Who is it for? What category?
      How is it different? What is the proof? Positioning drives everything.
      Bad positioning cannot be fixed by better tactics.
    examples:
      - Define target customer precisely
      - Choose category strategically
      - Articulate differentiation clearly
      - Support claims with evidence

  - name: Do Things That Do Not Scale
    description: |
      Early marketing is manual. Handwritten emails. Personal outreach.
      One-on-one demos. Things that teach you about customers before
      scaling. Premature scaling wastes money on wrong messages.
    examples:
      - Personal outreach to first 100 customers
      - Manual onboarding to learn friction points
      - Direct conversations before surveys
      - Quality over quantity early

  - name: One Channel Deeply
    description: |
      Startups win by going deep on one channel, not shallow on many.
      Master one acquisition channel before diversifying. Most successful
      startups found one channel that worked and scaled it.
    examples:
      - Choose channel that matches audience behavior
      - Develop expertise before switching
      - Measure true CAC and LTV per channel
      - Scale what works before experimenting

  - name: Message Market Fit
    description: |
      The words you use matter as much as the product. Test messaging
      continuously. The right message can 10x conversion. Message market
      fit is as important as product market fit.
    examples:
      - Test headlines and value props
      - Use customer language not internal language
      - A/B test continuously
      - Measure comprehension not just clicks

  - name: Distribution is Product
    description: |
      How people find you is part of the product. Build distribution
      into the product itself. Viral loops, integrations, content,
      community. Distribution afterthought means distribution failure.
    examples:
      - Design sharing into product
      - Build where customers already are
      - Create content customers want to share
      - Make referrals natural not forced

patterns:
  - name: Jobs-To-Be-Done Positioning
    description: Position around the job customers hire your product to do
    when: Defining positioning and messaging for a new product or market
    example: |
      Bad positioning: "We're a project management tool"
      JTBD positioning: "We help remote teams stay aligned without meetings"

      The job: Stay aligned as a remote team
      Alternative solutions: Daily standups, Slack, email, spreadsheets
      Why this wins: Async, organized, doesn't require synchronous time

      Position against the job, not just competitor products.

  - name: The Bullseye Framework
    description: Systematic process for finding your one scalable channel
    when: Early-stage company needs to identify best acquisition channel
    example: |
      Step 1: Brainstorm all possible channels (20+)
      Step 2: Rank by potential reach + cost + fit
      Step 3: Test top 5 with cheap experiments
      Step 4: Double down on the one that shows traction
      Step 5: Optimize until diminishing returns, then repeat

      Example test: $500 budget, 2 weeks, measure CAC and conversion

  - name: Conversion Funnel Optimization
    description: Systematically improve each stage of customer journey
    when: You have traffic but conversion rates are below benchmark
    example: |
      Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Purchase → Retention

      Measure drop-off at each stage:
      - 1000 visitors → 200 signups (20% conversion)
      - 200 signups → 40 trials (20% activation)
      - 40 trials → 8 paid (20% conversion)

      Focus on biggest bottleneck first (usually activation).
      10% improvement at each stage = 61% more revenue.

  - name: Customer Development Interviews
    description: Validate positioning and messaging before spending on marketing
    when: Before launching campaigns or scaling spend
    example: |
      Interview 10-20 target customers:
      - What problem were you trying to solve?
      - What alternatives did you consider?
      - What made you choose this solution?
      - How do you describe this to colleagues?

      Extract: Problem framing, comparison set, decision criteria, language.
      Use their exact words in marketing copy. Tests 10x better.

  - name: North Star Metric Selection
    description: Choose one metric that represents value delivery
    when: Setting up measurement framework for growth team
    example: |
      Not revenue (lagging). Not signups (vanity). The action that predicts retention.

      Spotify: Time spent listening
      Airbnb: Nights booked
      Slack: Messages sent by team
      Medium: Total time reading

      All growth initiatives should move the North Star.

  - name: Cohort Retention Analysis
    description: Track user groups over time to measure product-market fit
    when: Understanding if you have retention issues or growth issues
    example: |
      Week 0: 100 signups
      Week 1: 60 return (60% retained)
      Week 4: 40 return (40% retained)
      Week 12: 35 return (35% retained)

      Good: Retention curve flattens (35% stick long-term)
      Bad: Retention continues declining (leaky bucket)

      Fix retention before scaling acquisition.

guidance:
  vibe-coder: |
    Marketing is how people find your product. Start with:
    1. Who exactly is this for? Be specific.
    2. What problem does it solve? In their words.
    3. Where do these people hang out online?
    4. What would make them want to share this?

    Do not spend money on ads yet. Start with personal outreach.
    Talk to potential customers. Learn their language. Use it.

  builder: |
    Focus on positioning first:
    1. Target customer: Who gets most value?
    2. Category: What bucket does this fit in?
    3. Differentiation: Why this over alternatives?
    4. Proof: What evidence supports claims?

    Pick ONE channel to master. Most startups find success in:
    - Content/SEO (long game, compounds)
    - Community (if your audience gathers)
    - Direct outreach (always works early)
    - Paid (if unit economics work)

  developer: |
    Technical founders: marketing is not optional or someone else job.

    Distribution > Product in most markets. Build marketing into product:
    - Shareable outputs (reports, badges, exports)
    - API/integrations where users are
    - Content that ranks for problems you solve
    - Community around the problem space

    Measure: CAC, LTV, payback period, channel efficiency.

    Marketing strategy checklist:

    Positioning:
    - April Dunford framework: competitive alternatives, unique attributes,
      value, customer segment, market category

    Channels (prioritize by):
    - Where does target customer spend attention?
    - What is the CAC ceiling given LTV?
    - What is defensible over time?

    Message testing:
    - Headlines: problem-focused vs solution-focused vs outcome-focused
    - Social proof: which type converts best?
    - CTA: what action, what friction?

    Scale only proven playbooks. Document everything.

handoff:
  before:
    - Ensure product has some initial users or validation
    - Know who the target customer is
  after:
