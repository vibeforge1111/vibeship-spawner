  - id: channel-obsession
    summary: Chasing every new channel without mastering any
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We need to be on TikTok" "Everyone's doing LinkedIn" "Let's add Twitter/X"
      Half-effort on 10 channels, zero results on any of them.
    why: |
      Jack of all channels, master of none. Resources scattered.
      Every channel requires unique content, platform-specific strategy,
      dedicated time, and time to learn and iterate.
    solution: |
      1. Start with ONE channel
         - Where is your audience already?
         - What format fits your resources?

      2. Master it before expanding
         - Consistent growth
         - Repeatable playbook
         - Understood economics

      3. Add channels strategically
         - When current channel saturates
         - When resources available
         - When audience is proven there

      # Channel evaluation:
      □ Is your audience actually there?
      □ Can you produce quality content?
      □ Do you have time to engage?
      □ Can you measure results?

      If not 4/4 → don't start it
    symptoms:
      - Low engagement across all channels
      - No channel driving meaningful results
      - Team stretched too thin
      - Inconsistent posting everywhere

  - id: paid-media-trap
    summary: Relying on paid acquisition before product-market fit
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Let's run ads to get users" "We can buy our way to scale"
      Paying to fill a leaky bucket. Burns cash, masks problems.
    why: |
      Paid traffic reveals your problems faster. Bad retention = wasted spend.
      No PMF = paying for churners. Bad funnel = expensive leads.
      If it won't spread free, ads won't help.
    solution: |
      # When to use paid:
      ✓ Product-market fit proven
      ✓ Organic channels working
      ✓ Unit economics positive
      ✓ Funnel optimized

      # When NOT to use paid:
      ✗ Pre-PMF (fix product first)
      ✗ CAC > LTV (fix economics first)
      ✗ Low retention (fix product first)
      ✗ No organic traction (fix message first)

      # Use paid to ACCELERATE, not to CREATE demand
      # Scale what already works
      # Test at small scale first
    symptoms:
      - High CAC, low LTV
      - Traffic but no retention
      - Burning cash without growth
      - Ads are only growth source

  - id: vanity-metrics
    summary: Celebrating metrics that don't connect to business outcomes
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We got 1M impressions!" "Our followers grew 50%!"
      Meanwhile: Revenue flat. Users churning.
    why: |
      Feels like progress while making none. Page views, follower count,
      impressions without action - none of these are business outcomes.
    solution: |
      # Vanity metrics (avoid celebrating):
      - Page views (without engagement)
      - Follower count (without conversion)
      - Email list size (without opens/clicks)
      - Impressions (without action)

      # Real metrics (focus here):
      - Signups from traffic
      - Revenue from campaigns
      - Customer acquisition cost
      - Lifetime value
      - Activation rate
      - Retention rate

      # Metric hierarchy:
      Tier 1: Revenue, profit, customer count
      Tier 2: Conversion rates, CAC, LTV
      Tier 3: Engagement, traffic, awareness
    symptoms:
      - Celebrating impressions while revenue flat
      - Can't connect marketing to revenue
      - Reports look good, business doesn't grow
      - No full-funnel tracking

  - id: premature-scaling
    summary: Scaling marketing before channels are optimized
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Let's 10x the ad budget" before understanding what's working.
      Scaling waste scales waste. Scaling inefficiency scales losses.
    why: |
      10x budget with 2% conversion = 10x wasted money.
      Hiring before playbook = expensive discovery.
      Geographic expansion before PMF = chaos.
    solution: |
      # Before scaling, ensure:
      1. Repeatable playbook exists
         Same action → same result
         Documented, teachable

      2. Unit economics work
         CAC < LTV (with margin)
         Payback < acceptable

      3. Conversion optimized
         Each step of funnel optimized
         Low-hanging fruit picked

      4. Operations can handle it
         Systems ready for 10x leads
         Team can process volume

      # Scale checklist:
      □ Channel economics proven
      □ Conversion rates stable
      □ Content machine built
      □ Analytics in place
      □ Team/systems ready
    symptoms:
      - Scaling spend, same conversion rates
      - Can't train new team on playbook
      - Operations overwhelmed by volume
      - CAC rising with scale

  - id: message-mismatch
    summary: Marketing message doesn't match product reality
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Marketing: "The fastest solution!"
      Reality: Takes 2 weeks to onboard.
      Attracts wrong customers, creates churn, damages trust.
    why: |
      High churn (wrong expectations), negative reviews (disappointed users),
      support overload (confused customers), brand damage (broken promises).
    solution: |
      1. Use customer language
         What do actual users say?
         Testimonials > marketing speak

      2. Validate claims
         Can you prove it?
         Data backing claims

      3. Set honest expectations
         Under-promise, over-deliver
         "Most users see X in Y days"

      4. Message audit
         List all marketing claims
         For each: Is this true for most users?
         If no → revise or remove
    symptoms:
      - High early churn
      - Negative reviews about expectations
      - Support tickets about promises
      - Sales explaining "what we really meant"

  - id: campaign-tunnel-vision
    summary: Focusing only on campaigns, not systems
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Every quarter: "What's our big campaign?"
      Spikes of activity followed by silence. No compounding effect.
    why: |
      Campaigns are one-time. Systems compound.
      SEO content ranks forever. Email lists can be activated repeatedly.
      Referral programs grow exponentially.
    solution: |
      # Build compounding systems:
      SEO:
      - Content that ranks forever
      - Links that build over time
      - Traffic that grows monthly

      Email list:
      - Subscribers compound
      - Can be activated repeatedly
      - Owned audience

      Referral:
      - Each customer brings more
      - Zero CAC for referred

      # Balance: 80% systems, 20% campaigns
    symptoms:
      - Growth resets every quarter
      - No compounding traffic
      - No owned audience
      - Always starting from zero

  - id: competitor-obsession
    summary: Reacting to everything competitors do
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Competitor X launched feature Y, we need it"
      "They're on TikTok, we should be too"
      Always behind, losing differentiation.
    why: |
      You don't know if it's working for them. Your audience may be different.
      You lose your unique position. You're always playing catch-up.
    solution: |
      1. Watch, don't follow
         Track what competitors do
         Don't automatically react

      2. Double down on differences
         What can only you offer?
         What's your unique angle?

      3. Listen to YOUR customers
         What do they actually want?
         What would make them switch?

      4. Lead, don't follow
         Create new categories
         Own a unique position

      # Usually: Focus on your own game
    symptoms:
      - Roadmap driven by competitors
      - No unique positioning
      - Always reactive, never proactive
      - Customers can't distinguish you

  - id: feature-launch-fallacy
    summary: Treating every feature launch like it deserves a campaign
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Week 1: "Exciting new feature A!"
      Week 2: "Big announcement: Feature B!"
      Audience becomes deaf to announcements.
    why: |
      Most features don't warrant fanfare. Constant launches = noise.
      Real launches get buried. Audience becomes deaf.
    solution: |
      # Launch tiers:
      Tier 1: MAJOR (1-2 per year)
        New product line, major pivot
        Full campaign, PR, events

      Tier 2: SIGNIFICANT (quarterly)
        Major features, big updates
        Blog post, email, social

      Tier 3: NOTABLE (monthly)
        Good improvements
        In-product, changelog

      Tier 4: INCREMENTAL (ongoing)
        Small fixes, minor features
        Changelog only

      # Ask before launching:
      - Would customers actively seek this?
      - Does it change their workflow?
      - Is it story-worthy?
    symptoms:
      - Launch fatigue
      - Declining email open rates
      - Important launches ignored
      - '"Another update" attitude'

  - id: persona-paralysis
    summary: Creating detailed personas that never get used
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Let's create detailed personas" → Beautiful documents with dog names
      and coffee preferences → Filed away → Marketing doesn't change.
    why: |
      Weeks of work, no behavior change. Demographics don't drive decisions.
      Jobs-to-be-done matters more.
    solution: |
      # What actually matters:
      1. What problem do they have?
      2. What have they tried?
      3. Where do they look for solutions?
      4. What would make them act?
      5. What objections do they have?

      # Jobs-to-be-done format:
      "When [situation], I want to [job]
      so I can [outcome]."

      # Persona lite:
      Role + Problem + Goal + Objection
      Skip demographics unless targeting
      Focus on psychology and behavior
    symptoms:
      - Personas never referenced
      - Marketing doesn't match personas
      - Irrelevant details documented
      - No actionable insights

  - id: attribution-illusion
    summary: Believing attribution tools show the full picture
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Last-click attribution shows "Paid search drives all conversions"
      So you cut organic, social, brand. Conversions collapse.
    why: |
      User saw brand on Instagram, read blog via Google, got retargeted,
      searched brand name → converted. Attribution: "Paid search wins!"
      But whole funnel matters.
    solution: |
      # Attribution truths:
      - No tool captures everything
      - Many touches are invisible
      - Correlation ≠ causation
      - Self-reported often more accurate

      # Better approaches:
      1. Multi-touch attribution
      2. Marketing mix modeling
      3. Incrementality testing (turn off channel, measure)
      4. Ask customers ("How did you hear about us?")

      # Attribution humility:
      Treat data as directionally correct
      Not precisely accurate
      Make decisions holistically
    symptoms:
      - Cutting channels that quietly help
      - Over-investing in last-touch
      - Surprised when changes backfire
      - Can't explain attribution to leadership

  - id: content-graveyard
    summary: Publishing content that no one finds or reads
    severity: high
    situation: |
      200 blog posts, 10 monthly visitors, 0 leads.
      No SEO, no distribution, no strategy.
    why: |
      Time wasted, no SEO value, no leads.
      Build it ≠ they come.
    solution: |
      1. Quality over quantity
         One great post > five mediocre
         10x content strategy

      2. SEO from the start
         Keyword research before writing
         Match search intent
         Optimize on-page

      3. Distribution plan
         Where will you share?
         Who will amplify?
         How many times?

      4. Update old content
         Refresh top performers
         Better than new mediocre

      # Content checklist:
      □ Keyword target identified
      □ Search intent matched
      □ Better than current #1
      □ Distribution channels planned
      □ Measurement defined
    symptoms:
      - High content volume, low traffic
      - No organic growth
      - Blog is a graveyard
      - Can't tie content to revenue

  - id: discount-death-spiral
    summary: Training customers to wait for discounts
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "20% off this week!" "Black Friday: 40% off!" "Flash sale: 50% off!"
      Customers never pay full price. They wait for next sale.
    why: |
      Destroys pricing power, attracts deal-seekers who churn,
      repels value-seekers, destroys margins, creates expectations.
    solution: |
      1. Add value, don't cut price
         Bonus content, extended trial
         Extra features, better onboarding

      2. If discounting, be strategic
         New customer only (once)
         Annual payment incentive
         Exclusive, rare occasions

      3. Create urgency without discounts
         Limited availability
         Price going up
         Feature deadline

      4. Discount to segments, not everyone
         Students, nonprofits
         Not public broadcasts

      # Alternatives to discounts:
      Free trial extension
      Money-back guarantee
      Pay later options
      Freemium tier
    symptoms:
      - No one pays full price
      - Sales spike only during promos
      - Margins compressed
      - Customers waiting for deals
