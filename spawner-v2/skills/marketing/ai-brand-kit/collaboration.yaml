prerequisites:
  required_before_start:
    - skill: brand-positioning
      why: |
        Brand positioning must be clear before encoding into AI systems. Need
        defined target audience, differentiation, core message, and brand
        personality before creating AI-readable guidelines and prompts.

        Without clear positioning, AI guidelines become generic and fail to
        capture what makes brand unique. Positioning provides foundation for
        all brand AI training.

      what_you_need:
        - Brand positioning document
        - Target audience definition (psychographic, not demographic)
        - Brand differentiation and unique value
        - Brand personality and voice characteristics
        - Competitive landscape understanding

    - skill: marketing
      why: |
        Need marketing strategy and channel plan before building AI brand
        systems. Must know which channels will use AI generation, what
        content types are needed, and success metrics before creating
        prompt libraries.

        Marketing strategy defines scope: which channels need AI brand assets?
        Which content types to prioritize? What are goals and constraints?

      what_you_need:
        - Marketing channel plan
        - Content types by channel
        - Content volume requirements
        - Success metrics (engagement, conversion, etc.)
        - Resource constraints (team size, budget)

  helpful_but_not_required:
    - skill: copywriting
      why: |
        Existing strong brand copy provides foundation for voice training.
        If brand has 50+ examples of excellent copy, voice training is easier.
        But can build AI brand kit even with limited existing copy.

    - skill: design-systems
      why: |
        Established design system provides visual guidelines to encode into
        AI prompts. Color palette, typography, grid system become AI training
        inputs. But can build AI brand kit while design system is in progress.
