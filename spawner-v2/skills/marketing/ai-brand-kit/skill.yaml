principles:
  - principle: Brand is encoded in prompts, not just documents
    why: |
      AI tools need actionable instructions, not passive PDFs. Every brand
      guideline must translate to reusable prompts that AI can execute.
      Documents describe; prompts direct.

  - principle: Consistency requires negative prompts
    why: |
      Telling AI what NOT to generate is as critical as what to generate.
      Brand guardrails prevent style drift. "Never use gradients" is as
      important as "Always use bold typography."

  - principle: Visual style needs reference anchors
    why: |
      AI visual models learn from examples, not descriptions. Create a
      curated set of 10-20 "brand anchor" images that capture your aesthetic.
      These become your Midjourney style references and DALL-E training set.

  - principle: Voice training requires volume
    why: |
      Brand voice emerges from patterns across 50+ examples, not 5. Feed
      AI your best performing copy, tweets, emails. More signal = better
      voice capture. Quality matters but quantity enables learning.

  - principle: Governance beats creativity without it
    why: |
      AI generates infinite variations. Without approval workflows and
      version control, brand chaos ensues. Better to constrain early than
      clean up inconsistency later.

  - principle: Brand evolves - AI should too
    why: |
      Brands aren't static. Your AI training, prompts, and style references
      must version and evolve. Treat brand assets like code: version control,
      changelog, deprecation strategy.

  - principle: Context > generic brand voice
    why: |
      "Brand voice" is too broad. You need voice for social, email, docs,
      support, landing pages. Context-specific prompts beat one-size-fits-all.
      LinkedIn voice != Twitter voice.

  - principle: Benchmark quality to prevent drift
    why: |
      Without measurable quality standards, AI output degrades over time.
      Define 5-10 "gold standard" examples for each content type. New AI
      output must match or exceed these benchmarks.

  - name: Visual Style Tuning Workflow
    when: Training AI image generators on your brand aesthetic
    steps:
      - step: Curate brand anchor image set
        details: |
          Select 15-25 existing brand images that best capture your aesthetic.
          Include variety: product shots, lifestyle, graphics, UI screenshots.
          Each image should be high quality and clearly "on brand."

          Avoid: Stock photos, inconsistent styles, outdated assets.

      - step: Create Midjourney style reference
        details: |
          Upload anchors to Midjourney. Use --sref parameter with image URLs.
          Test with 20+ diverse prompts to validate consistency.
          Document which sref values (0-1000) work best for your brand.

          Example: `--sref https://brand.com/anchor1.jpg --sref 500`

      - step: Build DALL-E custom style
        details: |
          Use ChatGPT's DALL-E with detailed style instructions.
          Create Custom GPT with embedded brand guidelines.
          Include negative prompts in system instructions.
          Test across 10+ content types.

      - step: Train Flux LoRA (advanced)
        details: |
          For maximum control, train Flux LoRA on 50-100 brand images.
          Requires technical setup but gives fine-grained style control.
          Host on Replicate or RunPod for team access.
          Version LoRA models by training date.

      - step: Document prompt patterns
        details: |
          Record which prompt structures work best for your style.
          Note effective keywords, compositions, lighting terms.
          Build reusable prompt templates.
          Create negative prompt library.

      - step: Establish quality gates
        details: |
          Define what "on brand" means measurably.
          Create comparison grid with gold standards.
          Set approval workflow for new AI assets.
          Track style drift over time.

  - name: Voice Training Methodology
    when: Teaching AI to write in your brand voice across contexts
    steps:
      - step: Gather voice corpus
        details: |
          Collect 50-100 examples of your best brand writing.
          Organize by context: social, email, docs, ads, support.
          Include variety: short/long, formal/casual, urgent/evergreen.

          Quality over quantity but need volume for pattern detection.

      - step: Extract voice patterns
        details: |
          Use Claude/GPT to analyze corpus and identify:
          - Sentence structure patterns (short/long, simple/complex)
          - Common opening/closing patterns
          - Recurring phrases or formulations
          - Punctuation style (em-dashes, semicolons, etc.)
          - Vocabulary level and technical density
          - Use of questions, imperatives, statements

          Create structured voice profile document.

      - step: Build context-specific prompts
        details: |
          Don't use generic "brand voice" - create prompts for each context:

          - Twitter: [Voice characteristics + platform constraints]
          - Email newsletter: [Voice + format + CTA patterns]
          - Product docs: [Voice + clarity + technical level]
          - Support: [Voice + empathy + problem-solving]
          - LinkedIn: [Voice + professionalism + thought leadership]

          Each prompt embeds relevant corpus examples.

      - step: Create anti-voice guidelines
        details: |
          Explicitly state what NOT to write:
          - Forbidden phrases: "delighted to announce", "game-changer"
          - Banned structures: "In today's world of X..."
          - Tone violations: Corporate jargon, excessive exclamations

          Negative examples teach as much as positive ones.

      - step: Build Custom GPT / Claude Project
        details: |
          Create dedicated AI assistant with:
          - System instructions with voice guidelines
          - Corpus examples in knowledge base
          - Context-specific prompt templates
          - Brand terminology glossary

          Train team to use this vs generic ChatGPT.

      - step: Quality benchmark and iterate
        details: |
          Generate 20+ examples across contexts.
          Compare against corpus gold standards.
          A/B test with team: "Which sounds more like us?"
          Refine prompts based on misses.
          Version voice guidelines as brand evolves.

  - name: Asset Variation System
    when: Need to generate multiple on-brand variations efficiently
    structure: |
      Build system for controlled variation within brand constraints:

      ## Variation Dimensions
      Define what CAN vary while staying on brand:

      - Color: Primary palette variations, accent swaps
      - Composition: 3-4 approved layout structures
      - Imagery: Style-consistent image categories
      - Copy: Tone spectrum by context (formal ↔ casual)
      - Format: Dimensions/aspect ratios by channel

      ## Constraint System
      Define what MUST stay consistent:

      - Logo usage and clear space
      - Typography hierarchy and font pairings
      - Voice principles (even as tone varies)
      - Visual style references (same aesthetic DNA)

      ## Variation Prompts
      Create prompts with controlled randomness:

      ```
      Generate Instagram post with:
      - Style: {BRAND_STYLE_REF}
      - Color: {random: primary_palette}
      - Composition: {random: [layout_1, layout_2, layout_3]}
      - Subject: {PRODUCT}
      - Must include: {BRAND_ELEMENTS}
      - Never include: {BRAND_NEGATIVES}
      ```

      ## Batch Generation
      Use variation prompts to generate 10-20 options.
      Team selects best 2-3. Refine winners. Archive losers.

      ## Version Control
      Track which variations perform best.
      Retire low performers from rotation.
      Update prompts based on learnings.

  - name: Brand Consistency Checker
    when: Validating AI-generated content meets brand standards
    implementation: |
      Create AI-powered brand validation system:

      ## Visual Consistency Checker
      Prompt for image validation:

      ```
      You are a brand consistency validator for {BRAND}.

      Brand Guidelines:
      - Color palette: {COLORS}
      - Typography: {FONTS}
      - Visual style: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}
      - Must avoid: {NEGATIVES}

      Analyze this image and check:
      1. Color usage: In palette? Proportions correct?
      2. Typography: Approved fonts? Proper hierarchy?
      3. Style: Matches brand aesthetic? Reference images?
      4. Violations: Any forbidden elements?
      5. Overall: Brand-aligned? (1-10 score)

      Output: Pass/Fail + specific issues + suggestions
      ```

      ## Copy Consistency Checker
      Prompt for text validation:

      ```
      You are a brand voice validator for {BRAND}.

      Voice Guidelines:
      - Tone: {TONE_DESCRIPTION}
      - Forbidden phrases: {BLOCKLIST}
      - Example corpus: {EXAMPLES}

      Analyze this copy:
      "{TEXT_TO_CHECK}"

      Check:
      1. Voice match: Sounds like brand? (1-10)
      2. Forbidden phrases: Any violations?
      3. Tone appropriateness: Right for {CONTEXT}?
      4. Improvements: Specific suggestions to strengthen

      Output: Pass/Fail + issues + rewrite suggestions
      ```

      ## Automated Workflow
      Integrate checkers into approval flow:

      1. AI generates content
      2. Auto-run consistency checker
      3. If Pass: Send to human review
      4. If Fail: Show issues, suggest fixes, regenerate
      5. Track failure patterns to improve base prompts

      ## Feedback Loop
      When humans override checker (approve "fails" or reject "passes"),
      capture feedback to refine validation prompts.

  - name: Multi-Channel Brand Deployment
    when: Launching brand across multiple AI-powered channels
    strategy: |
      Coordinate consistent brand rollout across AI touchpoints:

      ## Channel Inventory
      Map all AI-enabled brand touchpoints:

      - Social: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok
      - Email: Newsletters, campaigns, transactional
      - Content: Blog, docs, landing pages
      - Support: Chatbots, help articles, FAQs
      - Ads: Google, Meta, LinkedIn
      - Internal: Slack bots, notion, docs

      ## Context Mapping
      For each channel, define:

      - Voice variation: How does brand tone adapt?
      - Visual requirements: Dimensions, format, style
      - Prompt templates: Channel-specific generation prompts
      - Quality benchmarks: Gold standard examples
      - Approval workflow: Who reviews before publish?

      ## Rollout Sequence
      Don't launch everywhere simultaneously:

      1. Start with 1-2 high-impact channels
      2. Generate 20+ examples, refine prompts
      3. Run for 2-4 weeks, gather feedback
      4. Update prompts based on learnings
      5. Expand to next channel tier
      6. Cross-pollinate learnings

      ## Consistency Monitoring
      As you scale across channels:

      - Weekly brand audits across channels
      - Track style drift metrics
      - User perception surveys
      - A/B test variations within brand
      - Update central brand guidelines
      - Sync prompt libraries across channels

  - name: Brand Evolution Management
    when: Brand needs to evolve while maintaining AI consistency
    process: |
      Manage brand changes without breaking AI systems:

      ## Version Your Brand
      Treat brand like code:

      - v1.0: Initial brand launch
      - v1.1: Minor refinements (color tweaks, voice adjustments)
      - v2.0: Major evolution (rebrand, new positioning)

      ## Changelog Everything
      Document what changed and why:

      ```markdown
      # Brand v2.0 - March 2024

      ## Visual Changes
      - Updated color palette: Warmer tones (old cold blues)
      - New typography: Inter → Geist Sans
      - Simplified logo: Removed gradient

      ## Voice Changes
      - Tone: More conversational, less corporate
      - Removed: Jargon, buzzwords
      - Added: Humor, personality

      ## AI Impact
      - Update all Midjourney srefs with new color palette
      - Retrain DALL-E custom GPT on new visual examples
      - Update voice corpus with recent best writing
      - Deprecate old prompt templates (archive in /archive)
      - Create v2 prompts in /prompts/v2
      ```

      ## Migration Strategy
      Don't flip switch overnight:

      1. Create parallel v2 prompt library
      2. Generate examples with both v1 and v2
      3. A/B test with team and users
      4. Gradually shift traffic to v2
      5. Archive v1 (don't delete - might need to reference)
      6. Update all AI training (GPTs, Claude Projects, etc.)

      ## Backward Compatibility
      Some systems might still need v1:

      - Keep v1 prompts available but deprecated
      - Document which systems use which version
      - Set sunset date for v1 retirement
      - Migrate systems incrementally

anti-patterns:
  - name: Style drift without monitoring
    why_bad: |
      AI output quality degrades silently over time. Prompts that worked
      great 3 months ago produce increasingly off-brand results as models
      update, team members change prompts, or brand context gets lost.
    instead: |
      Set up monthly brand audits. Compare current AI output against gold
      standards. Track drift metrics. When quality drops, investigate root
      cause: prompt degradation, model changes, or brand evolution. Update
      prompts and retrain before drift becomes crisis.

  - name: Inconsistent prompt libraries
    why_bad: |
      Team members create ad-hoc prompts in their own ChatGPT/Claude
      sessions. No central repository. Brand knowledge siloed. Copy from
      marketing sounds different than copy from sales. Every person
      reinvents the wheel.
    instead: |
      Centralize prompts in version-controlled repository. Team must use
      approved prompts for brand content. Contribute improvements back to
      library. Review and approve changes like code. Build Custom GPTs or
      Claude Projects that embed approved prompts.

  - name: No governance or approval workflow
    why_bad: |
      Anyone can generate and publish AI content without review. Brand
      consistency depends on individual judgment. No quality control. When
      something off-brand ships, no way to know who/how/why.
    instead: |
      Implement approval gates. AI-generated content must pass automated
      brand checker + human review before publish. Define who can approve
      what. Track all AI-generated assets. Require metadata: prompt used,
      model version, approver, date. Audit trail for accountability.

  - name: Over-constraining creativity
    why_bad: |
      Prompts so rigid they prevent good ideas. "Always use this exact
      structure" kills innovation. Brand guidelines become straitjacket.
      AI can't adapt to context. Output feels robotic and formulaic.
    instead: |
      Define brand constraints (voice, visual style) but allow creative
      variation within those bounds. Encourage experimentation with new
      prompts. Review innovations monthly - promote best to prompt library.
      Brand should enable creativity, not prevent it.

  - name: Under-training AI on brand
    why_bad: |
      Expect AI to understand brand from 2-3 example images or brief
      description. Insufficient training data. Models lack context to
      generate consistently. Every output requires heavy editing.
    instead: |
      Invest in comprehensive training. Visual: 15-25 anchor images minimum.
      Voice: 50+ examples across contexts. Create Custom GPTs with full
      brand knowledge base. Build Midjourney style references. Train Flux
      LoRAs for critical use cases. More training = less editing.

  - name: Ignoring cultural and accessibility context
    why_bad: |
      Brand prompts optimized for one market/language/culture. AI generates
      content that doesn't translate, offends, or excludes. Accessibility
      as afterthought. Alt text generic. Color contrast ignored.
    instead: |
      Build cultural awareness into prompts. For global brands, create
      locale-specific variations. Include accessibility requirements in
      all visual prompts: contrast ratios, alt text structure, readable
      typography. Test AI output with diverse users. Update prompts based
      on feedback.

  - name: Missing negative prompts
    why_bad: |
      Only tell AI what to include, not what to avoid. Models make
      assumptions that contradict brand. Generate off-brand elements
      because you didn't explicitly forbid them. "Don't use gradients"
      never specified, so gradients appear everywhere.
    instead: |
      For every positive brand guideline, create negative counterpart.
      Visual negatives: gradients, stock photo aesthetics, clichés.
      Voice negatives: jargon, buzzwords, corporate speak. Build
      comprehensive blocklists. Include in all prompts. Prevents drift.
