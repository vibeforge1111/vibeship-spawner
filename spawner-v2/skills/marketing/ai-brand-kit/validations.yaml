  - name: Brand Guidelines Document Structure
    check: |
      Brand AI guidelines must be structured for machine consumption,
      not just human reading. Check that document includes:

      Required sections:
      - Brand Essence: Core values (3-5 specific), voice adjectives (8-10),
        anti-brand (explicit rejections), target audience (psychographic)
      - Visual DNA: Color palette (hex codes), typography (font names),
        visual style references (15-25 curated images), negative examples
      - Voice Training Set: Best copy (50+ examples), voice spectrum by channel,
        forbidden phrases (blocklist), tone variations by context
      - Prompt Library Index: Links to visual, copy, and validation prompts

      Format requirements:
      - Markdown with clear headers (H2, H3) for AI parsing
      - Examples included, not just descriptions
      - Actionable instructions, not inspirational language
      - Quantified where possible (hex codes, not "warm colors")

      Red flags:
      - Generic brand values ("innovative", "customer-focused")
      - Visual descriptions without reference images
      - Voice guidelines without examples
      - No negative examples or forbidden elements
      - PDF format instead of markdown (AI can't consume well)
    fix: |
      Restructure document:
      1. Convert to markdown with clear heading hierarchy
      2. Add specific, actionable details (hex codes, font names)
      3. Include 50+ voice examples across content types
      4. Curate 15-25 visual reference images
      5. Add explicit forbidden elements lists
      6. Replace generic values with specific, differentiated ones

      2. Ensure variety: product, lifestyle, graphics, UI
      3. Remove any stock photos or inconsistent styles
      4. Verify resolution (upscale if needed)
      5. Get team consensus on each image
      6. Document why each image represents brand well

  - name: Voice Corpus Volume and Diversity
    check: |
      Voice training requires sufficient examples across contexts. Check
      that voice corpus meets requirements:

      6. Document what made each example successful

  - name: Negative Prompt Coverage
    check: |
      Every prompt must include negative prompts (what to avoid). Check

      Red flags:
      - Prompt has no negative prompts section
      - Generic negatives ("avoid bad quality")
      - Only 1-2 items in negative list
      - Negatives don't align with brand anti-patterns
      - Visual prompts lack style negatives
      - Voice prompts lack forbidden phrases
    fix: |
      Enhance negative prompts:
      1. Add explicit "Negative Prompts" section to every prompt
      2. Visual: List 5-10 specific forbidden elements
      3. Voice: List 10-15 forbidden phrases/patterns
      4. Reference brand anti-patterns from guidelines
      5. Include examples of what NOT to generate
