    summary: Trusting AI translation without native speaker review
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Publishing AI-translated content directly without having a native
      speaker review it, especially for marketing or customer-facing content.
    why: |
      AI translation is impressive but makes subtle errors that native speakers
      catch instantly. Idioms, humor, formality levels, cultural references—
      all can go wrong. Published errors damage brand and trust.
    solution: |
      REVIEW REQUIREMENTS:

      TIER 1: No review needed
      - Internal notes
      - Temporary content
      - Developer documentation

      TIER 2: Quick review (native speaker glance)
      - Support articles
      - FAQ content
      - Informational content

      TIER 3: Full review (native speaker + cultural check)
      - Marketing copy
      - Sales content
      - Customer communications

      TIER 4: Professional + review
      - Legal documents
      - Contracts
      - Regulated content

      NEVER SKIP REVIEW FOR:
      - Headlines and taglines
      - Product names
      - Anything emotional or persuasive
      - Content for sensitive markets

      # AI translates, humans validate
    symptoms:
      - Native speakers spot errors
      - Awkward phrasing
      - Lost nuance
      - Cultural missteps

  - id: cultural-blindness
    summary: Ignoring cultural differences beyond language
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Translating words but not adapting for cultural context, symbols,
      colors, gestures, or market-specific expectations.
    why: |
      Translation is just words. Localization is cultural adaptation.
      Thumbs up is offensive in some cultures. White means mourning in others.
      Same translated words can mean different things in cultural context.
    solution: |
      CULTURAL ADAPTATION CHECKLIST:

      COLORS:
      - White: Purity (West) vs Mourning (China, India)
      - Red: Danger (West) vs Luck (China)
      - Green: Nature (West) vs Islam (Middle East)
      - Yellow: Joy (West) vs Royalty (Thailand)
      - Purple: Luxury (West) vs Death (Brazil)

      GESTURES:
      - Thumbs up: Offensive in Middle East, Greece
      - OK sign: Offensive in Brazil
      - Pointing: Rude in many Asian cultures
      - Left hand: Unclean in Middle East/South Asia

      NUMBERS:
      - 4: Death in Chinese/Japanese (avoid)
      - 13: Bad luck in Western cultures
      - 7: Lucky in most Western cultures
      - 8: Lucky in Chinese culture

      IMAGERY:
      - Modesty standards (Middle East, South Asia)
      - Animal symbolism varies
      - Religious symbols sensitivity

      # When in doubt, get local review
    symptoms:
      - Negative market reaction
      - \'"Tone deaf" feedback\'
      - Social media backlash
      - Brand damage in market

  - id: text-expansion-blindness
    summary: Not accounting for text length changes across languages
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Translating UI, buttons, or designed layouts without accounting for
      the fact that some languages use significantly more or fewer characters.
    why: |
      German is ~30% longer than English. Chinese is often shorter.
      Buttons overflow, layouts break, text truncates. What fits in
      English may not fit in German. Design fails.
    solution: |
      TEXT EXPANSION FACTORS:

      LONGER THAN ENGLISH:
      - German: +30-35%
      - French: +15-20%
      - Spanish: +20-25%
      - Italian: +15-20%
      - Portuguese: +15-20%
      - Russian: +20-25%
      - Finnish: +30-40%

      SHORTER THAN ENGLISH:
      - Chinese: -20-30%
      - Japanese: -10-20%
      - Korean: -10-15%

      DESIGN SOLUTIONS:
      - Build 30% buffer into designs
      - Use flexible layouts
      - Test with longest language (usually German)
      - Truncation strategy for fixed-width elements
      - Shorter source text when possible

      UI SPECIFICS:
      - Buttons: Minimum 40% extra space
      - Headers: Allow wrapping
      - Navigation: Flexible width
      - Forms: Labels above fields, not beside
    symptoms:
      - Truncated text
      - Broken layouts
      - Overflowing buttons
      - Design inconsistency

  - id: idiom-literal-translation
    summary: Translating idioms literally instead of finding equivalents
    severity: high
    situation: |
      AI or literal translation of idioms, metaphors, and cultural
      expressions that don't translate directly.
    why: |
      "It's raining cats and dogs" literally translated makes no sense.
      Each language has equivalent expressions that convey the same meaning.
      Literal translation of idioms sounds bizarre or incomprehensible.
    solution: |
      IDIOM HANDLING:

      1. IDENTIFY IDIOMS IN SOURCE:
         - Mark colloquialisms
         - Flag metaphors
         - Note cultural references

      2. FIND EQUIVALENTS:
         - Same meaning, local expression
         - Not word-for-word translation
         - "What would a native say here?"

      3. WHEN NO EQUIVALENT:
         - Explain the meaning plainly
         - Don't force awkward translation
         - Cultural notes if needed

      EXAMPLES:
      "Break a leg" →
        French: "Merde!" (yes, really)
        German: "Hals- und Beinbruch!"

      "Piece of cake" →
        French: "C'est du gâteau" (similar)
        German: "Das ist ein Kinderspiel" (child's play)

      AI PROMPTS:
      "Translate this text. For idioms and colloquialisms,
      find equivalent expressions in [target language] rather
      than translating literally."
    symptoms:
      - Confusing expressions
      - \'"What does this mean?" feedback\'
      - Unnatural phrasing
      - Lost impact

  - id: right-to-left-failures
    summary: Not properly handling RTL languages
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Localizing for Arabic, Hebrew, or other RTL languages without
      proper layout mirroring and text handling.
    why: |
      RTL isn't just text direction—it's layout direction. Navigation
      moves right, images may need mirroring, number handling is complex.
      Partial RTL support looks broken.
    solution: |
      RTL CHECKLIST:

      LAYOUT:
      - Mirror entire UI (left ↔ right)
      - Navigation flows right-to-left
      - Forms and inputs aligned right
      - Progress indicators reversed

      TEXT:
      - Numbers stay LTR within RTL text
      - Currency symbols correct position
      - Phone numbers proper format
      - Dates in local format

      IMAGES:
      - Consider mirroring (depends on content)
      - Text in images must be RTL
      - Direction-specific icons (arrows, etc.)

      DESIGN:
      - Use CSS logical properties (start/end not left/right)
      - Test with actual RTL content
      - Native speaker review of layout

      LANGUAGES:
      - Arabic (AR)
      - Hebrew (HE)
      - Persian/Farsi (FA)
      - Urdu (UR)
    symptoms:
      - Text aligned wrong
      - Layouts look backward
      - Navigation confusing
      - Mixed direction issues

  - id: character-set-failures
    summary: Not supporting required character sets
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Fonts or systems that don't properly support characters needed
      for target languages (CJK, Arabic, Cyrillic, special diacritics).
    why: |
      Missing characters appear as boxes (□) or question marks.
      Breaks user experience completely. Font selection must support
      all target languages.
    solution: |
      CHARACTER SET CHECKLIST:

      CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean):
      - Thousands of unique characters
      - Need CJK-supporting fonts
      - Different character sets per language
      - Traditional vs Simplified Chinese

      ARABIC SCRIPT:
      - Connected letters (ligatures)
      - Multiple forms per letter
      - RTL rendering
      - Font must support Arabic

      CYRILLIC:
      - Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian differ
      - Specific characters per language
      - Most common Latin fonts lack support

      DIACRITICS:
      - European languages: àéïõü, etc.
      - Vietnamese: extremely complex
      - Many Latin fonts incomplete

      FONT STRATEGY:
      - Use Unicode-complete fonts
      - Google Noto fonts cover everything
      - Test with actual content
      - Fallback font chain
    symptoms:
      - □ or ? characters
      - Missing diacritics
      - Rendering errors
      - \'"Tofu" characters\'

  - id: voice-localization-mismatch
    summary: AI voice doesn't match avatar or expected speaker
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Using AI voice localization where the voice characteristics don't
      match what viewers expect from the speaker on screen.
    why: |
      Cognitive dissonance when voice doesn't match face. Age, gender,
      accent mismatch is jarring. Viewers sense something is wrong even
      if they can't articulate it.
    solution: |
      VOICE MATCHING:

      MATCH CHARACTERISTICS:
      - Gender of voice to speaker
      - Approximate age range
      - Energy level and pace
      - Regional accent appropriateness

      ELEVENLABS APPROACH:
      - Use voice cloning for consistent speaker
      - Or: Select similar voice from library
      - Test: Does this voice "fit" this face?

      HEYGEN/SYNTHESIA:
      - Platform often handles voice matching
      - But review before publishing
      - Same avatar needs same voice across languages

      ACCENT CONSIDERATIONS:
      - Local accent for local market
      - Neutral accent for broad reach
      - Avoid stereotypical accents

      # The voice should feel like it belongs to the speaker
    symptoms:
      - \'"Something's off" feeling\'
      - Viewer distraction
      - Reduced trust
      - Comments noting mismatch

  - id: legal-requirements-ignored
    summary: Not checking market-specific legal requirements
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Publishing content in new markets without checking local
      regulatory requirements, disclosures, or compliance needs.
    why: |
      Each country has different advertising regulations, privacy
      requirements, and disclosure rules. What's legal in US may
      be illegal in EU. Violations = fines, bans, legal issues.
    solution: |
      LEGAL CHECKLIST BY REGION:

      EU/EEA:
      - GDPR privacy compliance
      - Cookie consent requirements
      - \'"AI-generated" disclosure may be required\'
      - Environmental claims substantiation
      - Price display regulations

      GERMANY:
      - Strict advertising laws
      - Comparative advertising limits
      - Price marking requirements
      - Impressum requirements

      FRANCE:
      - French language requirements (Loi Toubon)
      - Specific discount claim rules
      - Health claim restrictions

      UK:

  - id: translation-memory-neglect
    summary: Not building and using translation memory
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Translating content repeatedly without saving and reusing
      approved translations for consistency and efficiency.
    why: |
      Same phrases translated differently = inconsistency.
      Re-translating approved content = wasted effort.
      Translation memory saves time and ensures consistency.
    solution: |
      TRANSLATION MEMORY SYSTEM:

      1. SAVE APPROVED TRANSLATIONS:
         - Source text → Approved translation
         - Segmented by sentence/phrase
         - Stored with context

      2. REUSE FOR NEW CONTENT:
         - Match against memory
         - Use approved translations for matches
         - Only translate new segments

      3. TERMINOLOGY DATABASE:
         - Product names (never translate)
         - Company terms (standard translation)
         - Technical vocabulary
         - Consistent across all content

      TOOLS:
      - Phrase, Lokalise, Crowdin built-in TM
      - Custom database if needed
      - AI can use as context

    summary: AI translation has telltale awkward patterns
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      AI-translated content that sounds technically correct but
      has the "machine translation" feel that native speakers recognize.
    why: |
      AI translations can be technically accurate but stylistically
      wrong. Word order, formality level, natural flow—all can feel
      "off" to native speakers. Damages perception of quality.
    solution: |
      IMPROVING AI TRANSLATION QUALITY:

      1. PROMPT ENGINEERING:
         "Translate to natural, native-sounding [language].
         Write as a native speaker would express this idea.
         Maintain conversational tone, not literal translation."

      2. CONTEXT PROVISION:
         - Brand voice description
         - Target audience
         - Formality level expected
         - Example approved translations

      3. POST-EDITING:
         - Native speaker review
         - Focus on naturalness, not just accuracy
         - "Would you say it this way?"

      4. MULTI-PASS:
         - First pass: AI translation
         - Second pass: AI self-review
         - Third pass: Human review

      COMMON TELLS:
      - Overly formal language
      - Word-by-word structure matching source
      - Unnatural word order
      - Missing contractions
      - Overuse of passive voice
    symptoms:
      - \'"Sounds translated" feedback\'
      - Stilted language
      - Native speakers notice immediately

    summary: Translating poorly written source content
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Translating source content that is itself unclear, jargon-heavy,
      or poorly written—making translation worse.
    why: |
      Garbage in, garbage out. If English source is confusing, translations
      will be worse. AI amplifies source problems. Clean source is essential
      for good translation.
    solution: |
      SOURCE QUALITY CHECKLIST:

      BEFORE TRANSLATION:
      □ Source is clear and unambiguous
      □ Short sentences (easier to translate)
      □ Minimal idioms and slang
      □ Technical terms defined
      □ No abbreviations (or list provided)
      □ Consistent terminology
      □ Simple sentence structure

      WRITING FOR TRANSLATION:
      - Subject-verb-object order
      - One idea per sentence
      - Avoid cultural references
      - Define jargon
      - Spell out acronyms first use

      INTERNATIONALIZATION:
      - Write source with translation in mind
      - Called "writing for translation" or i18n
      - Reduces translation difficulty and cost
      - Improves quality across all languages
    symptoms:
      - Translation reflects source confusion
      - Multiple interpretations possible
      - Inconsistent translations
      - Reviewer confusion
