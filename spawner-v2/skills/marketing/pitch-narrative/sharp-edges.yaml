# Pitch Narrative Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: solution-before-problem
    summary: Pitching solution before establishing problem
    severity: high
    situation: Audience isn't bought in on why this matters
    why: |
      Solution without problem context is meaningless.
      Audience hasn't been primed to care.
      Feels like selling, not solving.

      ## Problem-First Sequencing

      ### The Pattern That Fails

      ```
      Bad: "We built an AI-powered platform that..."
           (Audience: "Why should I care?")

      Good: "Every sales team loses 30% of deals because..."
            (Audience: "That's us...")
            "We built the solution..."
            (Audience: "Tell me more")
      ```

      ### Earning the Right to Solve

      **Problem Establishment Checklist**
      - [ ] Is the problem felt, not just understood?
      - [ ] Have I shown who suffers from this?
      - [ ] Is the cost of the problem clear?
      - [ ] Have I acknowledged current failed solutions?

      Only THEN introduce your solution.

      ### Time Allocation

      | Pitch Length | Problem Time | Solution Time |
      |--------------|--------------|---------------|
      | 2 minutes | 30-45 seconds | 45-60 seconds |
      | 5 minutes | 1-1.5 minutes | 2 minutes |
      | 30 minutes | 5 minutes | 10 minutes |

      Problem should be ~30% of setup before solution.

      ### Problem Depth Test

      Can you answer:
      1. Who experiences this problem? (Specific persona)
      2. When does it hurt most? (Situation trigger)
      3. What does it cost them? (Quantified impact)
      4. Why haven't they solved it? (Current alternatives)

      If not, your problem isn't established enough.
    symptoms:
      - "So what exactly does it do?"
      - Glazed eyes during solution section
      - No questions about product
    detection_pattern: "problem|pain point|why this matters"

  - id: too-many-ideas
    summary: Trying to convey too much in one pitch
    severity: high
    situation: Audience remembers nothing specific
    why: |
      Cognitive overload kills retention.
      Competing ideas dilute each other.
      No single message sticks.
    solution: |
      ## Message Discipline

      ### The One Big Thing

      ```
      Every pitch needs ONE dominant message:

      "After this pitch, they will remember that
       we [one thing]."

      Everything else supports this one thing.
      ```

      ### Message Hierarchy

      ```
      1. Primary Message (Must Remember)
         → One sentence they'll repeat

      2. Supporting Points (Should Remember)
         → 2-3 points that prove primary

      3. Details (Nice to Know)
         → Evidence, specifics, depth

      If running short on time:
      - Cut from bottom up
      - Never sacrifice primary message
      ```

      ### The Elevator Test

      ```
      If they only have 30 seconds to describe
      you to someone else, what will they say?

      Design for that sentence.
      ```

      ### Ruthless Cutting

      | Keep | Cut |
      |------|-----|
      | Supports main message | Interesting but tangential |
      | Differentiates you | True of competitors too |
      | Audience cares about | Only you care about |
      | Simple to explain | Requires long explanation |

      ### Post-Pitch Test

      Ask test audience: "What do you remember?"

      If they list 5+ things → too much
      If they list nothing clearly → message failed
      If they nail the one thing → success
    symptoms:
      - "That was a lot - let me look at the deck again"
      - Confused questions
      - Can't summarize what you do
    detection_pattern: "remember|message|takeaway"

  - id: generic-pitch
    summary: Same pitch for every audience
    severity: medium
    situation: Pitch doesn't resonate with specific audience
    why: |
      Different audiences care about different things.
      Generic feels like template.
      Misses connection opportunity.
    solution: |
      ## Audience-Specific Adaptation

      ### Audience Analysis Matrix

      | Audience | They Care About | Lead With |
      |----------|-----------------|-----------|
      | VCs | Returns, scale, team | Market size, traction |
      | Buyers | ROI, risk, ease | Their specific problem |
      | Partners | Revenue, differentiation | Mutual benefit |
      | Executives | Strategy, outcomes | Business impact |
      | Users | Features, ease | Demo, experience |

      ### Customization Levels

      **Level 1: Audience Type**
      - Different deck for VC vs customer
      - Different emphasis and language

      **Level 2: Segment**
      - Enterprise vs SMB
      - Industry vertical
      - Geographic region

      **Level 3: Individual**
      - Their company's situation
      - Their role's concerns
      - Their personal background

      ### The Research Rule

      ```
      Minimum 15 minutes research per pitch:

      - Recent news about them
      - Their company's public priorities
      - Their background (LinkedIn)
      - Mutual connections
      - Previous interactions

      Work 1-2 specific references into pitch.
      ```

      ### Customization Markers

      Show you did the work:
      - "I noticed you recently..."
      - "Given [their situation]..."
      - "For a company at your stage..."
      - "Based on what [mutual contact] said..."
    symptoms:
      - "This feels like a template"
      - No questions about their specifics
      - Pitch doesn't mention them
    detection_pattern: "customize|tailor|audience"

  - id: no-proof-points
    summary: Claims without evidence
    severity: medium
    situation: Audience skeptical but unconvinced
    why: |
      Claims are cheap.
      Without proof, sounds like hype.
      Credibility gap.
    solution: |
      ## Proof Point Strategy

      ### Proof Hierarchy

      | Proof Type | Credibility | When to Use |
      |------------|-------------|-------------|
      | Their own data | Highest | If you have it |
      | Case study (similar) | Very high | Similar company |
      | Case study (different) | High | Any customer |
      | Aggregate data | Medium | Patterns |
      | Expert endorsement | Medium | Industry authority |
      | Your credentials | Low-Medium | Team validation |
      | Projection/promise | Low | Avoid relying on |

      ### Claim → Proof Pairing

      ```
      Every major claim needs proof:

      Claim: "We reduce sales cycle by 40%"
      Proof: "Company X went from 6 weeks to 3.5 weeks"

      Claim: "Enterprise-grade security"
      Proof: "SOC 2 certified, 50 Fortune 500 customers"

      Claim: "Easy to implement"
      Proof: "Average deployment is 2 weeks; here's how..."
      ```

      ### Case Study Structure

      ```
      Context: "[Company] faced [challenge]"
      Action: "They implemented [solution]"
      Result: "In [timeframe], achieved [outcome]"
      Quote: "[Customer] says..."
      ```

      ### When You're Early

      Limited proof points? Use:
      - Founder credibility (past success)
      - Pilot results (even small)
      - Expert validation
      - Logical proof (why it must work)
      - "In our beta, we've seen..."
    symptoms:
      - "That sounds too good to be true"
      - "Do you have evidence?"
      - Skeptical body language
    detection_pattern: "proof|evidence|case study"

  - id: weak-opening
    summary: Starting without hooking attention
    severity: medium
    situation: Audience mentally checked out early
    why: |
      First 30 seconds set the tone.
      Boring start = uphill battle.
      Attention is earned, not given.
    solution: |
      ## Opening Hook Design

      ### Opening Types That Work

      **1. Surprising Statistic**
      "90% of X fail because of Y. We're the 10%."

      **2. Bold Claim**
      "We're making [category] obsolete."

      **3. Personal Story**
      "Three years ago, I was [relatable situation]..."

      **4. Provocative Question**
      "What would change if [big implication]?"

      **5. Common Belief Challenge**
      "Everyone assumes X. But what if Y?"

      **6. Customer Quote**
      "'This changed how we work' - [CEO of Company]"

      ### Opening Mistakes

      | Mistake | Problem | Fix |
      |---------|---------|-----|
      | "Thanks for having me" | Wasted time | Skip pleasantries |
      | "Let me introduce myself" | Boring | Establish later |
      | "Our company was founded..." | Self-focused | Start with them |
      | "Let me share my screen" | Technical | Be ready before |

      ### The 10-Second Test

      ```
      In first 10 seconds, audience should:
      - Know why this matters
      - Want to hear more
      - Be slightly surprised or intrigued

      If not, rewrite your opening.
      ```

      ### Opening Energy

      - Start with energy 20% higher than feels natural
      - Make eye contact immediately
      - Smile (if appropriate)
      - Move with purpose
      - Own the space
    symptoms:
      - People checking phones in first minute
      - Low energy in room
      - Questions like "so what is this about?"
    detection_pattern: "opening|start|attention"
