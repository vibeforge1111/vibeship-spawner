      CONCEPT SIMPLIFICATION:
      "Explain [complex concept] so a 12-year-old would understand.

       Rules:
       - No jargon
       - Use familiar analogies
       - Maximum 3 steps
       - Focus on benefits, not features"

      METAPHOR GENERATION:
      "Generate 5 metaphors to explain [concept]:

       For each metaphor:
       - The comparison
       - Why it works
       - Where it breaks down
       - Visual potential"

      JARGON AUDIT:
      "Review this script for jargon:
       [paste script]

       Flag every term that might confuse a non-expert.
       Suggest plain-language alternatives."

      THREE-STEP FRAMEWORK:
      "Collapse this process into exactly 3 steps:
       [describe complex process]

       Each step should:
       - Be memorable
       - Be actionable
       - Use simple language"
