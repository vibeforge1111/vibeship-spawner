    summary: Walking through features instead of telling a story
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Explainer video is structured as a feature list. "Our product has X,
      Y, and Z." Marketing team wants to show everything the product does.
      No narrative arc, no emotional connection, just a feature rundown.
      "We paid for 90 seconds, let's use it all for features."
    why: |
      Features don't create emotional connection; problems and transformations
      do. Viewers don't care about features until they feel the problem those
      features solve. A feature list is forgettable; a story of transformation
      is memorable. The goal isn't to inform—it's to make viewers feel that
      your product is the obvious solution to their problem.
    solution: |
      STORY OVER FEATURES:

      STRUCTURE SHIFT:
      - Before: "Our product has X, Y, Z"
      - After: "You have this problem. Here's how we solve it."

      NARRATIVE ARC:
      1. Problem (make them feel pain)
      2. Agitate (why current solutions fail)
      3. Solution (your product as hero)
      4. Transformation (life after)
      5. Action (what to do next)

      FEATURE INTEGRATION:
      - Features exist to solve problems
      - Introduce feature IN CONTEXT of problem
      - "Remember that problem? This feature solves it."
      - Max 3 features in 90 seconds

      EMOTIONAL BEATS:
      - Frustration → Relief
      - Confusion → Clarity
      - Struggle → Success

      # Story first, features second
    symptoms:
      - Boring, forgettable video
      - Low engagement metrics
      - "What does it actually do?"
      - No emotional response

  - id: jargon-overload
    summary: Using industry terminology that excludes viewers
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Script filled with technical terms. "Cloud-based SaaS solution with
      AI-powered automation." Expert wrote the script, curse of knowledge
      in full effect. Team assumes audience knows what these words mean.
      "But that's what it is."
    why: |
      The people who need explainers most are those least familiar with
      jargon. If they already understood the technical terms, they wouldn't
      need an explainer. Jargon creates distance and confusion. Plain language
      builds understanding and trust. Every jargon term is a potential exit
      point where confused viewers stop watching.
    solution: |
      JARGON ELIMINATION:

      TRANSLATION EXAMPLES:
      - "Cloud-based SaaS" → "Software that works anywhere"
      - "AI-powered" → "Learns and improves automatically"
      - "Integration" → "Connects with tools you already use"
      - "Scalable" → "Grows with you"
      - "Real-time" → "Instant"

      JARGON TEST:
      - Would a 12-year-old understand?
      - Would your mom understand?
      - Can you explain without buzzwords?
      - Is there a simpler word?

      SCRIPT REVIEW:
      1. Highlight every technical term
      2. For each: Is this necessary?
      3. If yes: Can it be explained simply?
      4. If no: Replace with plain language

      EXCEPTIONS:
      - Terms audience definitely knows
      - Unavoidable industry terms (define them)

      # Simple language = broad understanding
    symptoms:
      - Viewer confusion
      - "What does that mean?"
      - Drop-off at jargon moments
      - Excluding potential customers

  - id: solution-before-problem
    summary: Jumping to product without establishing need
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Video opens with product introduction. "Meet ProductX, the revolutionary..."
      Eager to show the solution. Problem mentioned briefly or assumed.
      Viewers don't yet care about the solution because they don't feel
      the problem.
    why: |
      Viewers don't care about your solution until they feel the problem.
      The problem statement creates the psychological need that your product
      fills. Without adequate problem setup, the solution feels irrelevant.
      The problem is the hook; the solution is the payoff.
    solution: |
      PROBLEM-FIRST STRUCTURE:

      TIME ALLOCATION:
      - Problem: First 30% of video
      - Solution: Middle 50%
      - CTA: Final 20%

      PROBLEM PRESENTATION:
      1. State the problem clearly
      2. Show the pain points
      3. Demonstrate failed alternatives
      4. Build to "there must be a better way"

      EMOTIONAL JOURNEY:
      - Make viewer nod along
      - "Yes, I have this problem"
      - "Yes, that's frustrating"
      - "Yes, I need a solution"
      - THEN introduce your product

      SYMPTOMS OF SUCCESS:
      - Viewers feel understood
      - Problem feels urgent
      - Solution feels like relief

      # Earn the right to present your solution
    symptoms:
      - Low engagement
      - Early drop-off
      - '"So what?" reaction'
      - Solution feels irrelevant

  - id: too-long
    summary: Explainer video exceeds optimal length for context
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Landing page explainer is 3 minutes. "But we have so much to say."
      Trying to explain everything. No ruthless editing. Fear of leaving
      anything out. Video keeps growing during production.
    why: |
      Attention is limited. Data shows significant drop-off after 90 seconds
      for landing page explainers. Longer videos have lower play rates.
      Every second that doesn't add value subtracts from impact. A focused
      60-second video outperforms a meandering 3-minute video.
    solution: |
      LENGTH GUIDELINES:

      BY CONTEXT:
      - Landing page: 60-90 seconds
      - Email/social: 30-60 seconds
      - Product demo: 2-3 minutes (max)
      - Training: 5-7 minutes (segmented)

      EDITING RUTHLESSNESS:
      - Every second must earn its place
      - One message per video
      - Cut what can be cut
      - If in doubt, leave it out

      SCRIPT MATH:
      - 150 words ≈ 60 seconds
      - Count words before recording
      - Read aloud to verify timing
      - Plan for animation timing too

      IF YOU HAVE MORE TO SAY:
      - Create a series
      - Deep-dive videos for interested viewers
      - Link to detailed content

      # Shorter is almost always better
    symptoms:
      - Low completion rates
      - Declining retention curve
      - '"Too long" feedback'
      - Bloated script
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: curse-of-knowledge
    summary: Assuming viewers know what you know
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Expert wrote the script. Assumes background knowledge. Skips
      foundational concepts. "Everyone knows what an API is." Makes
      logical leaps that lose viewers. Team too close to product to see
      from outsider perspective.
    why: |
      The curse of knowledge: once you know something, you can't imagine
      not knowing it. This leads to explainers that skip crucial context
      and make leaps that lose viewers. Your product is your daily life;
      for viewers, it's their first exposure. What's obvious to you is
      new to them.
    solution: |
      CURSE ANTIDOTES:

      OUTSIDER TESTING:
      1. Test with someone outside industry
      2. Note every question they ask
      3. These are gaps in your explainer
      4. Revise until zero questions

      ASSUMPTION AUDIT:
      - List every assumption script makes
      - For each: Can we remove this assumption?
      - Add brief context where needed
      - Explain, don't assume

      PERSPECTIVE SHIFT:
      - Viewer has never seen this product
      - Viewer may not know the problem exists
      - Viewer hasn't thought about this today
      - Viewer needs guided introduction

      REVIEW PROTOCOL:
      - Fresh eyes on every script
      - Non-expert reviewer required
      - "Does this make sense?" test

      # Assume zero prior knowledge
    symptoms:
      - Viewer confusion
      - Questions about basics
      - "Wait, what's a..."
      - Logical leaps that lose people

  - id: animation-decoration
    summary: Adding motion that doesn't support the message
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Animation is pretty but purposeless. Motion added to "make it more
      interesting." Effects don't connect to what's being said. Animation
      budget driving decisions. "We paid for animation, let's use it."
    why: |
      Animation should clarify, not decorate. Every motion should help
      viewers understand the message better. Purposeless animation distracts
      from the message and inflates production cost. The best explainer
      animation is invisible—viewers understand better without noticing
      why.
    solution: |
      PURPOSEFUL ANIMATION:

      BEFORE ANIMATING, ASK:
      1. Does this motion clarify the message?
      2. Would a static image work as well?
      3. Does motion add or distract?
      4. What is this animation communicating?

      GOOD ANIMATION:
      - Shows how something works
      - Guides eye to important element
      - Creates emotional response
      - Makes abstract concrete

      BAD ANIMATION:
      - Movement for movement's sake
      - Decorative background elements
      - Distracting transitions
      - Style over substance

      SIMPLICITY:
      - Sometimes static is better
      - White space is not wasted
      - Pauses can be powerful

      # If it doesn't clarify, cut it
    symptoms:
      - Animation disconnected from content
      - "Looks nice but..."
      - Message lost in motion
      - Style over substance

  - id: no-clear-cta
    summary: Failing to tell viewers what to do next
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Explainer ends without clear action. Multiple CTAs compete. "Learn
      more, sign up, contact us, or follow us." Viewer confused about
      next step. Video fades out without direction.
    why: |
      Confused viewers take no action. Every explainer should lead to a
      single, clear next step. Multiple CTAs dilute each other. The video's
      job is to move viewers to action—without clear direction, even
      convinced viewers don't know what to do.
    solution: |
      CTA CLARITY:

      SINGLE ACTION:
      - One CTA only
      - Clear, specific instruction
      - "Start your free trial" (not "Learn more")
      - Make it obvious what happens next

      CTA STRUCTURE:
      1. State the action: "Start your free trial"
      2. Reduce friction: "No credit card required"
      3. Create urgency: "Today" or time-limited
      4. Show visual: Button, URL, QR code

      VERBAL + VISUAL:
      - Say the CTA out loud
      - Show it on screen
      - Hold for 3-5 seconds
      - Make it the last thing seen

      LANDING PAGE COORDINATION:
      - CTA matches landing page
      - Same language
      - Clear continuity

      # Tell them exactly what to do
    symptoms:
      - Low conversion from video
      - "What do I do now?"
      - Multiple competing CTAs
      - Confusing next step

  - id: wrong-metaphor
    summary: Using metaphors that confuse rather than clarify
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Metaphor chosen is more complex than the concept. Metaphor doesn't
      accurately represent the product. Extended metaphor breaks down.
      "It's like a Swiss Army knife meets a library meets a butler."
    why: |
      Metaphors should make abstract concrete and unfamiliar familiar.
      A bad metaphor creates new confusion instead of clarity. If the
      metaphor requires its own explanation, it's not working. The metaphor
      should be simpler than the thing it explains.
    solution: |
      METAPHOR SELECTION:

      GOOD METAPHOR TEST:
      - Is it more familiar than the concept?
      - Does it accurately represent the key point?
      - Can it extend without breaking?
      - Would a child understand it?

      METAPHOR DEVELOPMENT:
      1. Identify the core concept to explain
      2. Find something familiar that works similarly
      3. Test: "It's like [X] because [Y]"
      4. Verify accuracy doesn't break down

      EXAMPLES:
      - API → "Waiter taking your order" ✓
      - Cloud → "Renting vs. owning" ✓
      - "Swiss Army knife library butler" ✗

      WHEN TO SKIP:
      - If you can't find a good one
      - If direct explanation is clear
      - If metaphor adds complexity

      # Simpler than the concept it explains
    symptoms:
      - "Wait, I'm more confused now"
      - Metaphor needs explanation
      - Accuracy breaks down
      - Mixed metaphors
