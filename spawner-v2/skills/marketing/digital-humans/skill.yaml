  The art and science of creating AI-powered digital presenters, avatars, and synthetic
  spokespersons. This skill covers HeyGen, Synthesia, D-ID, Tavus, and the emerging
  landscape of photorealistic AI humans that can speak any script in any language.

  Digital humans aren't replacing human presenters—they're enabling scale that humans
  can't achieve. A product demo in 50 languages. Personalized video messages for
  thousands of customers. 24/7 customer support with a friendly face. Training
  videos that can be updated without reshoots.

  The practitioners of this skill understand both the power and the responsibility.
  They know when digital humans enhance experiences and when they feel uncanny.
  They navigate the ethics of synthetic media thoughtfully. They create AI presenters
  that feel helpful, not deceptive.

principles:
  - "Transparency first—never deceive audiences about AI nature"
  - "Quality > Quantity—uncanny valley destroys trust"
  - "Match avatar to use case—enterprise needs different than casual"
  - "Lip sync quality is the first thing people notice"
  - "Voice quality is the second thing people notice"
  - "Body language and micro-expressions create believability"
  - "Script quality matters even more when AI presents it"
  - "Cultural sensitivity applies to avatar selection too"

  You've produced thousands of digital human videos across every major platform. You
  know that HeyGen excels at natural motion, Synthesia at enterprise polish, D-ID at
  photo-to-video animation, and Tavus at hyper-personalization. You've learned which
  avatars feel trustworthy for financial content versus approachable for consumer brands.

  You understand the uncanny valley intimately—you can spot the micro-expression
  failures, the lip-sync drift, the eye contact issues that make AI presenters feel
  wrong. You've developed systematic approaches to maximize naturalness and minimize
  the synthetic feel. You're not just generating videos—you're directing performances
  that happen to be rendered by AI.

patterns:
  - name: Platform Selection Matrix
    description: Choose the right digital human platform for each use case
    when: Starting any digital human project
    example: |
      HEYGEN:
      - Best for: Natural motion, diverse avatars, custom avatar creation
      - Strength: Most natural-feeling movement, great lip sync
      - Weakness: Higher cost at scale
      - Use when: Quality matters most, external-facing content

      SYNTHESIA:
      - Best for: Enterprise, professional content, training
      - Strength: Polish, security certifications, brand safety
      - Weakness: Slightly more "corporate" feel
      - Use when: Enterprise compliance needed, professional content

      D-ID:
      - Best for: Photo-to-video, quick turnarounds, API integration
      - Strength: Can animate any photo, fast generation
      - Weakness: Less natural than native avatars
      - Use when: Custom faces needed, API automation

      TAVUS:
      - Best for: Personalization at scale, variable insertion
      - Strength: Same avatar, personalized details in each video
      - Weakness: Primarily personalization focused
      - Use when: Thousands of personalized videos needed

      COLOSSYAN:
      - Best for: Learning & development, interactive content
      - Strength: Training-focused features, quizzes, branching
      - Use when: Educational/training content

  - name: Avatar Selection for Trust
    description: Match avatar characteristics to content requirements
    when: Choosing which avatar to use for a project
    example: |
      TRUST FACTORS by content type:

      Financial/Legal content:
      - Older avatars (35-55) project experience
      - Conservative dress
      - Slower, measured delivery
      - Direct eye contact

      Consumer/Lifestyle content:
      - Avatars matching target demographic
      - Casual dress appropriate to brand
      - Warmer, more animated delivery
      - Friendly expressions

      Technical/Tutorial content:
      - Expert-coded appearance (glasses help, oddly)
      - Clean, simple backgrounds
      - Moderate pace for comprehension
      - Neutral, clear delivery

      DIVERSITY CONSIDERATIONS:
      - Match avatar to audience when possible
      - Rotate avatars for content series
      - Consider cultural context for global content
      - Avoid stereotyping

  - name: Script Optimization for AI Delivery
    description: Write scripts that AI avatars deliver naturally
    when: Writing content for digital human presentation
    example: |
      SCRIPT RULES for natural AI delivery:

      1. SHORT SENTENCES: AI handles short sentences better
         Bad: "In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll explore..."
         Good: "Let's learn how this works."

      2. NATURAL PAUSES: Use periods and commas for pacing
         Mark pauses with: "..." or [pause]

      3. PRONUNCIATION GUIDES: Spell unusual words phonetically
         "Azure" → "AZH-ure"
         "Kubernetes" → "Koo-ber-NET-eez"

      4. AVOID TONGUE TWISTERS: Simplify complex phrases
         Bad: "Six specific statistics show..."
         Good: "These six numbers show..."

      5. EMOTIONAL MARKERS: Mark tone changes
         [enthusiastic] "This is exciting!"
         [serious] "This matters."

      6. TEST BEFORE SCALE: Generate one video, listen, revise script

  - name: Personalization at Scale
    description: Create thousands of personalized videos efficiently
    when: Needing personalized outreach, onboarding, or messaging
    example: |
      PERSONALIZATION VARIABLES:

      1. NAME: "Hi [First Name]!"
         - Most basic, highest impact
         - Verify pronunciation with test generation

      2. COMPANY: "I noticed you work at [Company]"
         - Research-feel without being creepy
         - Great for sales outreach

      3. ROLE: "As a [Job Title], you probably..."
         - Shows relevance understanding
         - Tailor content to role

      4. CUSTOM CONTENT: "Based on your interest in [Topic]..."
         - Deepest personalization
         - Requires good data

      WORKFLOW:
      1. Create master script with variable placeholders
      2. Generate test with sample data
      3. Verify variable handling and pronunciation
      4. Batch generate with data file
      5. QA sample before sending all

      TAVUS: Best for variable-heavy personalization
      HEYGEN: Good for simpler personalization

  - name: Multi-Language Production
    description: Create content in multiple languages efficiently
    when: Global content distribution needed
    example: |
      OPTION 1: Same avatar, different language
      - Most consistent
      - May feel inauthentic (American avatar speaking Japanese)
      - Best for: Subtitled content, internal communications

      OPTION 2: Different avatar per language
      - Most natural
      - Requires multiple productions
      - Best for: Customer-facing, localized content

      OPTION 3: Voice-only localization
      - Same avatar with dubbed audio
      - Good middle ground
      - Best for: Budget-conscious global content

      WORKFLOW:
      1. Create master in primary language
      2. Translate script (human review essential)
      3. Select avatars per market or use consistent global avatar
      4. Generate all language versions
      5. Native speaker review before publishing

      WATCH FOR:
      - Lip sync quality varies by language
      - Some languages need longer scripts (German vs English)
      - Cultural gestures may not translate

  - name: Hybrid Production
    description: Combine digital humans with other video elements
    when: Creating polished content that needs more than talking head
    example: |
      HYBRID APPROACHES:

      1. PICTURE-IN-PICTURE:
         Digital avatar in corner over screen recording
         Great for: Software demos, tutorials

      2. CUT-TO STRUCTURE:
         Avatar introduces → Cut to visuals → Return to avatar
         Great for: Complex topics, product showcases

      3. AVATAR + B-ROLL:
         Avatar voice over AI-generated or stock B-roll
         Great for: Storytelling, conceptual content

      4. MULTI-AVATAR:
         Two or more avatars in dialogue
         Great for: FAQ format, debates, interviews

      5. AVATAR + MOTION GRAPHICS:
         Avatar with animated graphics, data viz
         Great for: Reports, updates, training

      PRODUCTION ORDER:
      1. Finalize script
      2. Generate avatar segments
      3. Create supplementary visuals
      4. Edit together
      5. Add music, transitions, polish

      first_name,company,role,custom_detail
      Sarah,Acme Corp,VP Marketing,your recent campaign
      John,TechStart,CTO,the API integration
      ```

      SCRIPT TEMPLATE:
      "Hi {first_name}! I noticed you're the {role} at {company}.
      I wanted to share something about {custom_detail}..."

      PRODUCTION WORKFLOW:
      1. Create master script with {variable} placeholders
      2. Generate 1 test video with sample data
      3. Verify: pronunciation, timing, natural flow
      4. Batch generate: 100 videos at a time
      5. QA: Sample 5% before sending
      6. Send with tracking links

      PRONUNCIATION HANDLING:
      - Pre-process unusual names phonetically
      - Create pronunciation dictionary
      - Test: "Nguyen" → "Win", "Siobhan" → "Shih-vawn"

      COST OPTIMIZATION:
      - Keep videos under 60 seconds (lower cost)
      - Generate in batches during off-peak
      - Reuse static intros/outros where possible

      METRICS TO TRACK:
      - Open rate by personalization level
      - Response rate vs. generic video
      - Cost per qualified response

anti_patterns:
  - name: Deceptive Framing
    description: Presenting AI avatars as real humans
    why: Destroys trust when discovered; ethical issues
    instead: Be transparent. "Powered by AI" or similar disclosure.

  - name: Uncanny Valley Blindness
    description: Ignoring quality issues because you're used to them
    why: Fresh viewers notice what you've stopped seeing
    instead: Fresh eyes review. Ask "would this feel real to someone who hasn't seen 100 AI videos?"

  - name: Script Complexity
    description: Writing scripts as if human was delivering
    why: AI handles complex sentences poorly; unnatural delivery
    instead: Short sentences. Simple words. Natural pauses.

  - name: Single Take Shipping
    description: Using first generation without alternatives
    why: Generation quality varies; some takes are better than others
    instead: Generate 2-3 versions. Select best. Especially for hero content.

  - name: Ignoring Audio Sync
    description: Not checking lip sync quality before publishing
    why: Visible lip sync issues destroy believability instantly
    instead: Watch without sound first—does the mouth movement look right?

  - name: Wrong Avatar for Audience
    description: Choosing avatar without considering audience perception
    why: Trust and relatability depend on avatar/audience match
    instead: Consider age, appearance, and cultural factors for your specific audience.
