  - id: over-animation
    summary: Animating everything just because you can
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Every element on screen is moving. Constant motion competes for
      attention. Designer showing off animation skills rather than serving
      the message. Viewer doesn't know where to look. More effects added
      to "make it more dynamic."
    why: |
      Animation should guide attention, not scatter it. When everything moves,
      nothing stands out. The viewer's eye jumps chaotically, processing motion
      instead of absorbing message. Over-animation signals amateur work—
      professionals show restraint. The best motion design is invisible;
      viewers feel it without noticing it.
    solution: |
      PURPOSEFUL ANIMATION:

      BEFORE ANIMATING, ASK:
      1. What does this motion communicate?
      2. What should the viewer focus on?
      3. Would this be clearer without animation?
      4. Does this support or distract from message?

      ANIMATION BUDGET:
      - One primary animation at a time
      - Supporting elements can move subtly
      - Static elements provide rest for the eye
      - Build to moments, don't sustain constant motion

      RESTRAINT TECHNIQUES:
      - Stagger animations sequentially
      - Use holds/pauses between movements
      - Reserve big motion for key moments
      - Embrace negative space and stillness

      RULE: If you can remove an animation
      and nothing is lost, remove it.

      # Less motion, more impact
    symptoms:
      - Viewer doesn't know where to look
      - '"Too busy" feedback'
      - Message lost in motion
      - Eye fatigue watching content

  - id: linear-easing
    summary: Using linear motion instead of proper easing curves
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Elements move from A to B at constant speed. No acceleration or
      deceleration. Motion feels robotic and mechanical. Using software
      defaults without adjustment. "It's moving, so it's animated."
    why: |
      Nothing in the real world moves linearly. Everything accelerates and
      decelerates—objects have mass, physics applies. Linear motion immediately
      registers as unnatural and artificial. Easing is what separates
      professional animation from amateur. It's the difference between
      motion that feels alive and motion that feels like a PowerPoint.
    solution: |
      EASING FUNDAMENTALS:

      NEVER USE LINEAR:
      - Ease Out: Fast start, slow finish (entering screen)
      - Ease In: Slow start, fast finish (exiting screen)
      - Ease In-Out: Slow start, fast middle, slow finish

      STANDARD VALUES (After Effects):
      - Default ease: 75% influence
      - Snappy ease: 85-90% influence
      - Gentle ease: 50-60% influence
      - Custom bezier for specific feels

      WHEN TO USE WHAT:
      - Objects appearing: Ease Out
      - Objects disappearing: Ease In
      - Position changes: Ease In-Out
      - UI elements: Quick Ease Out (200-300ms)

      BEYOND BASIC EASING:
      - Overshoot for bounce/energy
      - Anticipation before big moves
      - Follow-through after stops

      # If it's linear, it's wrong
    symptoms:
      - Robotic, mechanical feeling
      - "Looks like PowerPoint"
      - Motion feels lifeless
      - Amateur perception

  - id: timing-uniformity
    summary: All animations have the same duration
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Every element animates over the same time period. Small icons and
      large backgrounds move at the same speed. Everything starts and
      ends together. No variation in timing creates monotonous rhythm.
    why: |
      Uniform timing feels mechanical and boring. In nature, different
      objects move at different speeds based on mass, distance, and urgency.
      Timing variation creates visual rhythm and hierarchy. The eye is drawn
      to timing differences—use this to guide attention to what matters.
    solution: |
      TIMING PRINCIPLES:

      PHYSICS-BASED TIMING:
      - Larger elements = longer duration
      - Smaller elements = shorter duration
      - Heavier feeling = slower
      - Lighter feeling = faster

      GENERAL DURATIONS:
      - Micro-interactions: 100-200ms
      - Standard UI: 200-400ms
      - Page transitions: 300-500ms
      - Large reveals: 500-1000ms

      CREATING RHYTHM:
      - Stagger start times (offset by 50-100ms)
      - Vary durations within groups
      - Use delay to create sequence
      - Pause on important moments

      HIERARCHY THROUGH TIMING:
      - Primary element moves first
      - Supporting elements follow
      - Important things land last (emphasis)

      # Variety in timing = life
    symptoms:
      - Monotonous rhythm
      - No visual hierarchy
      - Boring, predictable motion
      - "Feels robotic"

  - id: animation-audio-mismatch
    summary: Motion that ignores or fights the audio track
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Animation created without audio reference. Motion hits don't match
      music beats. Text appears out of sync with voiceover. Audio and
      animation feel like separate projects combined.
    why: |
      Motion and audio must dance together. The human brain seeks
      audio-visual synchronization—when it's off, something feels wrong
      even if viewers can't articulate it. Music and motion reinforce each
      other exponentially when synced; they fight each other when not.
    solution: |
      AUDIO-SYNC WORKFLOW:

      WORK WITH AUDIO FROM START:
      1. Get audio track before animating
      2. Mark key beats/moments on timeline
      3. Animate to audio, not vice versa
      4. Scrub frequently to check sync

      SYNC POINTS:
      - Music hits = major visual changes
      - Voiceover words = text appearance
      - Beat drops = big reveals
      - Pauses = visual emphasis

      TECHNIQUES:
      - Mark audio waveform beats
      - Use time remapping to adjust
      - Slip audio to fix near-misses
      - Add sound design to reinforce motion

      IF NO AUDIO YET:
      - Imagine a rhythm while animating
      - Design motion with clear beat structure
      - Make it easy to sync later

      # Motion and audio are dance partners
    symptoms:
      - "Something feels off"
      - Animation and music fighting
      - Text out of sync with voiceover
      - Disconnected audio-visual experience

  - id: trend-chasing
    summary: Prioritizing trendy effects over clear communication
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Designer wants to use the latest effect everyone's doing. Glitch
      effects, liquid motion, morphs—because they're trending. Style
      chosen before considering message. Effects looking for a reason
      to exist.
    why: |
      Trends fade; clear communication endures. Trendy effects can feel
      dated quickly and may not suit the brand or message. The job is
      communication, not showcasing awareness of trends. Effects should
      amplify message, not distract from it.
    solution: |
      MESSAGE-FIRST DESIGN:

      BEFORE CHOOSING STYLE:
      1. What is the message?
      2. Who is the audience?
      3. What is the brand?
      4. What emotion should it evoke?
      5. THEN: What style supports all of the above?

      TREND EVALUATION:
      - Does this trend fit the brand?
      - Will this feel dated in 6 months?
      - Does this serve or distract from message?
      - Is this trend or timeless design?

      TIMELESS ALTERNATIVES:
      - Clean typography
      - Purposeful motion
      - Strong color/contrast
      - Clear hierarchy

      WHEN TRENDS ARE OK:
      - Brand is young/trendy
      - Short-lived content (social)
      - Audience expects cutting-edge

      # Style follows strategy
    symptoms:
      - Style doesn't match brand
      - Work feels dated quickly
      - Message lost in effects
      - "It looks cool but..."

  - id: file-size-explosion
    summary: Delivering unoptimized files that cause performance issues
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Lottie animation is 2MB. Web animation causes lag. Video file is
      unnecessarily large. GIFs are 20MB. Client's site slows down after
      adding animations. Mobile users especially affected.
    why: |
      Laggy animation is worse than no animation. Large files cause load
      times, battery drain, and poor user experience. Optimization is part
      of the craft—a beautiful animation nobody can see is worthless.
      Performance is a feature.
    solution: |
      OPTIMIZATION BY FORMAT:

      LOTTIE (web animation):
      - Target: <100KB for most
      - Simplify shapes
      - Remove unused properties
      - Use bodymovin optimization settings
      - Test in browser before delivery

      VIDEO:
      - Use H.265/HEVC when supported
      - Right resolution for delivery
      - Appropriate bitrate (not max)
      - Consider variable bitrate

      GIF (avoid if possible):
      - Use WebP or MP4 instead
      - If GIF required: <5 seconds
      - Limit colors
      - Reduce dimensions

      TESTING:
      - Test on target platform
      - Test on mobile
      - Test on slow connection
      - Measure actual performance

      # Fast animation > pretty animation
    symptoms:
      - Laggy playback
      - Long load times
      - '"Too large" complaints'
      - Mobile performance issues

  - id: no-style-frames
    summary: Starting animation without approved style frames
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Animator starts work without design approval. Visual style developed
      during animation. Client sees animation and doesn't like the look.
      Significant rework required. "I thought you'd like it."
    why: |
      Animation is time-intensive. If the visual style isn't approved
      beforehand, you may create beautiful animation in the wrong style.
      Style frames are cheap; animated revisions are expensive. Get design
      approval before investing animation time.
    solution: |
      STYLE FRAME PROCESS:

      BEFORE ANIMATION:
      1. Create 3-5 key frames
      2. Show composition and color
      3. Include typography treatment
      4. Demonstrate icon/graphic style
      5. Get explicit client approval

      STYLE FRAME CONTENTS:
      - Color palette in context
      - Typography hierarchy
      - Character/icon style
      - Background treatment
      - Overall composition

      APPROVAL CHECKLIST:
      [ ] Client reviewed frames
      [ ] Feedback incorporated
      [ ] Written approval received
      [ ] Changes are frozen

      ONLY THEN: Start animation

      # Approve the look before the motion
    symptoms:
      - "Not what I expected"
      - Major rework after animation
      - Style revisions mid-project
      - Wasted animation time
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: ignoring-composition
    summary: Focusing on motion while neglecting visual composition
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Animation is well-executed but frames look unbalanced. No clear
      focal point. Elements placed arbitrarily. Motion covers up weak
      composition. Individual frames would fail as static designs.
    why: |
      Every frame should work as a still image. If you pause the animation
      and the composition is weak, motion is papering over design problems.
      Strong composition makes motion more impactful; weak composition
      makes even good motion feel off.
    solution: |
      COMPOSITION FUNDAMENTALS:

      APPLY TO EVERY KEY FRAME:
      - Rule of thirds
      - Visual hierarchy
      - Clear focal point
      - Balanced negative space
      - Contrast and emphasis

      FRAME-BY-FRAME CHECK:
      - Pause at key moments
      - Would this work as still?
      - Is there clear hierarchy?
      - Where does the eye go?

      COMPOSITION IN MOTION:
      - Maintain balance during movement
      - Guide eye with motion path
      - Don't break composition mid-transition
      - End frames should be strongest

      # Good design first, then good motion
    symptoms:
      - Weak still frames
      - Unbalanced composition
      - Unclear visual hierarchy
      - Motion covering design problems
