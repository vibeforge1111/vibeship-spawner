# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Classical Animation
    insight: |
      Disney animators defined principles:
      - Squash and stretch
      - Anticipation
      - Staging
      - Follow-through and overlap
      - Slow in/slow out (easing)
      - Timing and spacing
      Motion graphics inherits animation DNA.
    applies_when: "Creating any animation"

  - domain: Music
    insight: |
      Musicians know rhythm:
      - Beats create structure
      - Rests are as important as notes
      - Tempo affects emotion
      - Syncopation creates interest
      - Crescendo builds excitement
      Animation is visual music.
    applies_when: "Timing animation to audio"

  - domain: Choreography
    insight: |
      Dancers know movement:
      - Weight and momentum
      - Contrast in dynamics
      - Spatial relationships
      - Group synchronization
      - Stillness is powerful
      Motion graphics is choreography for objects.
    applies_when: "Animating multiple elements together"

  - domain: Typography
    insight: |
      Typographers know letters:
      - Hierarchy guides reading
      - Spacing affects perception
      - Weight carries meaning
      - Motion can enhance or destroy readability
      - Type has personality
      Kinetic type must respect typography.
    applies_when: "Animating text and titles"

    - Real-time engines (Unreal, Unity) expanding
    - AR/VR creating new opportunities

    Core principles remain stable.
