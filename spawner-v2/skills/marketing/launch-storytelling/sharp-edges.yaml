# Launch Storytelling Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: overhype-underdeliver
    summary: Launch hype exceeds product reality
    severity: high
    situation: Excitement turns to disappointment
    why: |
      Set unrealistic expectations.
      Product can't match narrative.
      Trust damaged.
    solution: |
      ## Managing Expectations

      ### The Hype-Reality Gap

      ```
      Hype Level → Expectation → Reality → Reaction

      Over-hype: High → Very High → Medium → Disappointment
      Right-size: High → High → High → Satisfaction
      Under-sell: Medium → Medium → High → Delight
      ```

      ### Expectation Setting

      **Do This**
      - Be specific about what it does
      - Show real product, not mockups
      - Include limitations honestly
      - Let product speak for itself

      **Don't Do This**
      - Superlatives without proof ("revolutionary")
      - Vague promises ("changes everything")
      - Hide limitations
      - Over-produced visuals

      ### Promise-Proof Alignment

      | You Promise | You Prove |
      |-------------|-----------|
      | "Fastest" | Speed benchmarks |
      | "Easiest" | User test videos |
      | "Best" | Comparison data |
      | "First" | No competitors do X |

      If you can't prove it, don't promise it.

      ### Early Access Reality Check

      ```
      Before launch, have 10 users try it:
      - Did they understand it?
      - Did it work as promised?
      - What confused them?
      - Does experience match messaging?
      ```

      ### Recovery from Overhype

      1. Acknowledge gap honestly
      2. Share what you're fixing
      3. Show quick improvements
      4. Rebuild trust gradually
    symptoms:
      - Negative comments after launch
      - "This isn't what I expected"
      - Refund requests

  - id: bad-timing-collision
    summary: Launch collides with major event
    severity: high
    situation: Launch drowned out by bigger news
    why: |
      Didn't check calendar.
      Ignored competition timing.
      External event overshadowed.
    solution: |
      ## Launch Timing Protection

      ### Pre-Launch Calendar Check

      **Check These Calendars**
      - Major tech events (Apple, Google, Microsoft)
      - Industry conferences
      - Competitor launch patterns
      - Political/news cycles
      - Holidays and observances

      ### Timing Red Flags

      | Event | Avoid Because |
      |-------|---------------|
      | Apple keynotes | Media coverage vacuum |
      | Major elections | News overwhelmed |
      | Industry flagships | Competitive noise |
      | Breaking news | Attention elsewhere |
      | Friday before holiday | Low attention |

      ### Contingency Planning

      ```
      Have 2-3 alternative dates ready.

      If collision detected:
      - Assess impact severity
      - Decide delay vs proceed
      - Communicate change early
      - Adjust messaging if needed
      ```

      ### Opportunistic Timing

      Sometimes collisions are good:
      - Related news amplifies relevance
      - Competitor misstep creates opening
      - Industry conversation matches your story

      ### Last-Minute Collision Protocol

      ```
      If major event happens day before:

      1. Assess: Will this help or hurt?
      2. If hurt: Delay 1-2 weeks
      3. If neutral: Proceed with adjusted expectations
      4. If help: Lean in, connect narratives
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Launch coverage minimal
      - Drowned out by other news
      - Lower than expected engagement
    detection_pattern: "timing|calendar|launch date"

  - id: silent-launch
    summary: Launch with no noise
    severity: medium
    situation: Product released but nobody noticed
    why: |
      Expected product to speak for itself.
      No marketing support.
      Minimal launch effort.
    solution: |
      ## Minimum Viable Launch

      ### Even "Quiet" Launches Need

      ```
      Absolute minimum:
      - Blog post announcing
      - Email to existing users/list
      - Social media posts
      - Update to website

      Takes: 4-8 hours
      Impact: 10x vs no launch
      ```

      ### When Quiet is Right

      **Intentionally quiet for:**
      - Early beta (want feedback, not traffic)
      - Sensitive features (rolling out carefully)
      - B2B enterprise (private announcements)
      - Testing messaging

      **Not quiet because:**
      - No time/resources
      - Don't know how
      - Assume it's not important

      ### Staged Launch Approach

      ```
      Week 1: Soft launch (limited audience)
      Week 2: Community launch (core users)
      Week 3: Public launch (full push)

      Each stage builds on previous learnings
      ```

      ### Post-Launch Amplification

      If launch was too quiet:
      - Re-launch with different angle
      - "What you might have missed"
      - Customer story as launch content
      - Product Hunt or community launch

      You can launch the same thing multiple times.
    symptoms:
      - Few signups on launch
      - "I didn't know you launched"
      - Minimal coverage
    detection_pattern: "quiet launch|soft launch|no marketing"

  - id: one-and-done
    summary: No post-launch content plan
    severity: medium
    situation: Momentum dies within 24 hours
    why: |
      All effort on launch day.
      No sustained content.
      Audience forgets.
    solution: |
      ## Post-Launch Content Engine

      ### The 14-Day Runway

      ```
      Pre-plan content for 14 days after launch:

      Day 1: Launch
      Day 2: Behind the scenes
      Day 3: User story
      Day 4: Feature deep-dive
      Day 5: FAQ/common questions
      Day 6: Community reaction
      Day 7: Week 1 metrics
      Day 8-14: Variations of above
      ```

      ### Content Recycling

      **One Launch, Many Posts**
      - Launch video → clips for social
      - Blog post → thread → newsletter
      - Customer quote → graphic → case study
      - FAQ → individual explainer posts

      ### Milestone Marketing

      ```
      Create celebration moments:
      - "100 users in 24 hours!"
      - "First Fortune 500 customer"
      - "1000 projects created"
      - "Featured in [publication]"
      ```

      ### User Story Pipeline

      **Start capturing immediately:**
      - Reach out to early users
      - Ask permission to share
      - Quote in social posts
      - Build toward case studies

      ### Sustaining Attention

      | Week | Focus |
      |------|-------|
      | Week 1 | Launch content, reactions |
      | Week 2 | User stories, deep dives |
      | Week 3 | Learnings, improvements |
      | Week 4 | Re-launch angle or update |
    symptoms:
      - Traffic spike then crash
      - Silence after launch day
      - "What happened to X?"
