    summary: Leading with features instead of benefits
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Ad copy lists what the product does (features) instead of what the
      customer gets (benefits). "Our AI analyzes data" instead of "Make
      better decisions faster."
    why: |
      Nobody cares about features until they care about benefits. Features
      are means; benefits are ends. Customers want outcomes, not capabilities.
      "What's in it for me?" must be answered immediately.
    solution: |
      FEATURE → BENEFIT TRANSLATION:

      THE FORMULA:
      Feature: "What it does"
      Benefit: "So you can..." / "Which means..."

      EXAMPLES:
      Feature: "AI-powered analytics"
      Benefit: "Know exactly what's working—without the guesswork"

      Feature: "Real-time syncing"
      Benefit: "Your team always has the latest version"

      Feature: "256-bit encryption"
      Benefit: "Your data is protected from hackers"

      PROCESS:
      1. List all features
      2. For each, ask "So what?"
      3. Keep asking until you hit emotion
      4. Lead with that

      HIERARCHY:
      - Emotional benefit (confidence, relief, success)
      - Practical benefit (save time, save money)
      - Feature (how we deliver)

      # Lead with benefit. Feature supports.
    symptoms:
      - Copy reads like spec sheet
      - '"Our product has..." language'
      - No emotional resonance
      - Low click-through rates

  - id: multiple-messages
    summary: Trying to say everything in one ad
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Ad tries to communicate multiple value propositions, features, or
      benefits. "Save time AND money AND increase quality AND..."
    why: |
      Multiple messages = no message. Human attention is limited. When you
      say everything, people remember nothing. One ad, one point. If you
      have multiple things to say, make multiple ads.
    solution: |
      ONE MESSAGE RULE:

      THE TEST:
      Can you describe your ad in one sentence?
      If you need "and," you have too many messages.

      PROCESS:
      1. What's the ONE thing we want them to know?
      2. What's the ONE thing we want them to do?
      3. Everything else = different ad

      PRIORITY:
      - If you could only say one thing, what would it be?
      - That's your ad.

      MULTIPLE BENEFITS:
      - Make separate ads for each
      - Test which resonates most
      - Winner becomes focus

      EXAMPLE:
      BAD: "Save time, save money, and get better results
            with our all-in-one platform"
      GOOD: "Cut report time by 80%"

      # One ad = one message
    symptoms:
      - '"And" appears multiple times'
      - Hard to summarize the ad
      - Confused viewer feedback
      - Trying to please everyone
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: clever-over-clear
    summary: Prioritizing cleverness over clarity
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Ad uses wordplay, puns, or clever references that the target audience
      might not understand. Copywriter loves it. Audience is confused.
    why: |
      Confused viewers don't click. The best ad copy is clear, not clever.
      Every second spent decoding is a second they could scroll. Clarity is
      more important than creativity.
    solution: |
      CLARITY TEST:

      THE 10-YEAR-OLD TEST:
      Would a smart 10-year-old understand the offer?
      If not, simplify.

      THE STRANGER TEST:
      Show someone with no context.
      Can they explain what you're selling in 5 seconds?

      CLARITY CHECKLIST:
      □ Is the offer obvious?
      □ Is the benefit clear?
      □ Is the CTA specific?
      □ No jargon?
      □ No insider references?

      WHEN CLEVER WORKS:
      - When the audience is definitely in on the joke
      - When clarity is maintained underneath
      - When it's been tested, not assumed

      WHEN IN DOUBT:
      Clear. Always clear.
      You're not winning awards; you're winning clicks.

      # Clear converts. Clever confuses.
    symptoms:
      - '"You''ll get it once you read it twice"'
      - Puns that require explanation
      - Industry inside jokes
      - Low CTR despite "good" copy

  - id: missing-cta
    summary: Ad without clear call to action
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Ad makes good points about the product but doesn't tell the viewer
      what to do next. No clear call to action.
    why: |
      Every ad is a transaction: attention for action. If you don't ask
      for the action, you've wasted the attention. "Click here" or "Learn
      more" is weak but better than nothing. Best is specific and valuable.
    solution: |
      CTA REQUIREMENTS:

      EVERY AD NEEDS:
      - Clear action (what to do)
      - Clear value (what they get)
      - Clear friction (what it costs—ideally low)

      CTA FORMULA:
      [Action Verb] + [Specific Result] + [Low Friction]

      EXAMPLES:
      "Get Your Free Report"
      "Start Your Free Trial—No Credit Card Needed"
      "Download the Guide (2-minute read)"
      "Book a 15-Minute Demo"

      AVOID:
      - '"Click Here" (what happens when I do?)'
      - '"Learn More" (about what?)'
      - '"Contact Us" (for what purpose?)'

      CTA PLACEMENT:
      - Button/link text
      - End of body copy
      - Headline can include CTA hint

      # No CTA = wasted attention
    symptoms:
      - Good engagement, no conversions
      - Viewer doesn''t know next step
      - '"Learn More" as default'
      - No urgency or value in action
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: wrong-audience-language
    summary: Using language that resonates with you, not them
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Ad copy uses terminology, references, or framing that makes sense to
      the copywriter or company but not to the target customer.
    why: |
      You're not the target audience. Your words aren't their words. The
      best ad copy sounds like something the customer would say, not
      something a marketer would write.
    solution: |
      AUDIENCE LANGUAGE RESEARCH:

      SOURCES FOR THEIR WORDS:
      - Customer reviews (yours and competitors)
      - Reddit/forums where they discuss
      - Customer support tickets
      - Sales call recordings
      - Survey open-ended responses
      - Social comments

      PROCESS:
      1. Gather verbatim customer language
      2. Note exact phrases they use
      3. Use their words in your copy
      4. Test whether it resonates

      EXAMPLE:
      Marketer language: "Optimize your workflow efficiency"
      Customer language: "Stop wasting time on busywork"

      VOICE OF CUSTOMER:
      "Our product helps with [their exact words]"
      Not "Our product helps with [marketing speak]"

      # Their words, not yours
    symptoms:
      - '"Nobody talks like that" feedback'
      - Marketing speak in ad copy
      - Jargon they don''t use
      - Disconnect with actual customers

  - id: no-proof
    summary: Making claims without supporting evidence
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Ad makes bold claims but provides no proof—no numbers, no testimonials,
      no logos, no specifics that make the claim believable.
    why: |
      Audiences are skeptical. Unsupported claims are ignored or disbelieved.
      Proof transforms claim into credibility. The more specific the proof,
      the more believable the claim.
    solution: |
      PROOF ELEMENTS:

      TYPES OF PROOF:
      - Numbers: "47% increase in conversions"
      - Testimonials: "Saved us 10 hours/week—Sarah, CMO"
      - Social proof: "10,000+ companies use..."
      - Authority: "Featured in Forbes"
      - Specifics: "In 23 days, we helped..."

      MAKING CLAIMS BELIEVABLE:
      Weak: "Increase your conversions"
      Strong: "Clients see 47% more conversions on average"

      Weak: "Great customer service"
      Strong: "95% satisfaction rating, 5-minute response time"

      PROOF PLACEMENT:
      - Support headlines with proof in body
      - Social proof in ad itself or landing page
      - Testimonial as headline

      WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE PROOF:
      - Get proof first
      - Make softer claims
      - Use aspirational framing: "designed to help..."

      # Claims without proof = ignored
    symptoms:
      - Skeptical responses
      - '"Yeah right" reactions'
      - No numbers in copy
      - Vague claims everywhere

  - id: too-long
    summary: Ad copy exceeding platform limits or attention spans
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Ad copy is too long—truncated by platform limits, or just more than
      anyone will read in a thumb-scrolling context.
    why: |
      Platform limits are hard constraints. Attention limits are soft but
      real. Every extra word is friction. The best ad copy is as short as
      possible while still communicating the full message.
    solution: |
      LENGTH GUIDELINES:

      META ADS:
      - Primary text: Hook in first 125 chars
      - Headline: Under 40 chars (25 for mobile)
      - Description: 30 chars (often hidden)

      GOOGLE ADS:
      - Headlines: 30 chars each (hard limit)
      - Descriptions: 90 chars each

      LINKEDIN:
      - Intro text: Hook in first 150 chars
      - Headline: Under 70 chars

      GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
      - Shorter is almost always better
      - Front-load important info
      - Truncation = failure
      - Mobile is primary—design for it

      EDITING PROCESS:
      1. Write full message
      2. Cut by 50%
      3. Cut again by 25%
      4. Is the core message intact?
      5. If not, simplify message, not just words

      # If it's truncated, it's failed
    symptoms:
      - '"..." in ad display'
      - Wall of text on mobile
      - Key info below fold/truncation
      - Low completion rates

  - id: urgency-without-reason
    summary: Fake urgency that damages trust
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Ad creates urgency without legitimate reason: "Act now!" with no
      deadline, "Limited time" with no end date, "Only X left" that never changes.
    why: |
      Fake urgency destroys trust. Audiences have seen it all. When every
      email is "Last Chance" and nothing ever ends, urgency becomes noise.
      Real urgency works; manufactured urgency backfires.
    solution: |
      LEGITIMATE URGENCY:

      REAL URGENCY:
      - Actual deadline (date/time specific)
      - Actual scarcity (limited inventory, seats, etc.)
      - Actual event (webinar, sale end)
      - Actual consequence (price increase, feature removal)

      URGENCY DONE RIGHT:
      "Ends Friday at midnight"
      "Only 12 spots left for Q1 cohort"
      "Price increases to $X on [date]"

      URGENCY DONE WRONG:
      "Act now!" (why now?)
      "Limited time offer" (until when?)
      "Don't miss out" (miss what?)

      ALTERNATIVES TO FAKE URGENCY:
      - Value clarity (why they want it)
      - Social proof (why others chose it)
      - Problem urgency (cost of waiting)
      - Ease (low friction to act)

      # Real urgency only
    symptoms:
      - '"Limited time" with no end date'
      - Same "urgency" ad running for months
      - Skeptical customer comments
      - Trust erosion

  - id: no-differentiation
    summary: Copy that could be for any competitor
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Ad copy is so generic it could describe any competitor in the space.
      No unique value proposition, no differentiation, no reason to choose
      you specifically.
    why: |
      In a competitive market, "me too" copy loses. If your ad could be
      competitor's ad with logo swap, you've failed. The ad must answer
      "why you vs. them?"
    solution: |
      DIFFERENTIATION IN COPY:

      THE COMPETITOR TEST:
      Cover your logo. Could this be competitor's ad?
      If yes, you need differentiation.

      DIFFERENTIATION SOURCES:
      - Unique feature/approach
      - Specific results you achieve
      - Unique customer you serve
      - Unique perspective/philosophy
      - Unique proof/credibility

      DIFFERENTIATION COPY:
      "The only [product] that [unique thing]"
      "Unlike [alternative], we [difference]"
      "[Specific result] for [specific audience]"

      IF NO DIFFERENTIATION:
      - Find one (positioning work needed)
      - Create one (offer, guarantee, etc.)
      - Be more specific (narrow audience)
      - Outexecute (if identical, be better at delivery)

      # Why you, specifically?
    symptoms:
      - Copy is generic
      - Logo-swap test fails
      - No competitive mention
      - '"Could be anyone" feedback'

  - id: untested-assumptions
    summary: Assuming what works without testing
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Making decisions about headlines, CTAs, angles based on opinion or
      assumption rather than data. "I think this headline is better."
    why: |
      In performance marketing, data beats opinion. What you think will
      work often doesn't. What seems "boring" often outperforms "creative."
      The market decides what's good; testing reveals it.
    solution: |
      TESTING DISCIPLINE:

      TEST EVERYTHING:
      - Headlines (biggest lever)
      - CTAs (often surprising results)
      - Body copy length
      - Tone/style
      - Proof elements
      - Urgency approaches

      TESTING PROCESS:
      1. Hypothesis: "X will improve because Y"
      2. Test: Run both versions with sufficient traffic
      3. Analyze: Statistical significance reached?
      4. Learn: Why did winner win?
      5. Iterate: Test against new challenger

      WHAT TO TEST FIRST:
      1. Headline variations (biggest impact)
      2. CTA variations
      3. Angle/message
      4. Proof elements
      5. Copy length

      AVOID:
      - Assuming based on opinion
      - Stopping tests too early
      - Not documenting learnings
      - Winner stays forever untested

      # Data > opinion. Always.
    symptoms:
      - '"I think this is better" decisions'
      - No testing process
      - Same ads running forever
      - No performance data on variations
