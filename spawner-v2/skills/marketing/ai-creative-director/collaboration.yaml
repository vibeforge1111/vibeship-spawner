# ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS
# ============================================================================
orchestration_patterns:
  - name: Sequential Production
    description: Each phase completes before next begins
    use_when: Dependencies are strict, quality is priority
    flow: |
      Brief → Hero Assets → Batch → Enhancement → Assembly → QA → Delivery
    example: |
      1. Get brief approved
      2. Generate hero image (ai-image-generation)
      3. Get hero approved
      4. Generate batch variations
      5. Enhance/upscale (ai-visual-effects)
      6. Add audio (ai-audio-production)
      7. Final assembly and QA

  - name: Parallel Workstreams
    description: Independent content types produced simultaneously
    use_when: Tight timeline, content types are independent
    flow: |
      Brief → [Images | Video | Audio | Avatars] → Integration → QA
    example: |
      After brief approval, simultaneously:
      - Image team: ai-image-generation
      - Video team: ai-video-generation
      - Audio team: ai-audio-production
      Then integrate in assembly phase

  - name: Hub-and-Spoke
    description: Central hero drives all derivative content
    use_when: Strong hero asset should define all others
    flow: |
      Brief → Hero → [Derivative A | B | C | D] → QA
    example: |
      1. Create perfect hero image
      2. Use as style reference for:
         - Video generations
         - Additional images
         - Avatar backgrounds
      3. All content inherits hero style

  - name: Iterative Refinement
    description: Cycles of creation and feedback
    use_when: Creative direction is exploratory
    flow: |
      Brief → Generate → Review → Refine → Generate → Review → ...
    example: |
      Round 1: 3 directions (ai-image-generation)
      Review: Select direction
      Round 2: 5 variations of selected
      Review: Refine elements
      Round 3: Final polish
      Approval: Lock and scale

# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Film Production
    insight: |
      Traditional production phases apply to AI:
      - Pre-production: Brief, planning, references (don't skip)
      - Production: Asset generation (this is faster now)
      - Post-production: Still needed, still important
      The ratio shifts (less production, more pre/post) but phases remain.
    applies_when: "Planning any multi-asset production"

  - domain: Agency Creative Process
    insight: |
      Agency workflows optimize for quality and client approval:
      - Strategy → Creative → Production → Review cycles
      - Multiple creative directions before commitment
      - Consolidated feedback rounds
      These practices prevent rework in AI production too.
    applies_when: "Managing client or stakeholder involvement"

  - domain: Manufacturing
    insight: |
      Manufacturing concepts apply to AI asset production:
      - Quality control at source, not just final inspection
      - Batch processing for efficiency
      - Template standardization for consistency
      - Continuous improvement through documentation
    applies_when: "Scaling to high-volume production"

  - domain: Agile Development
    insight: |
      Agile principles apply to creative production:
      - Iterative delivery over big bang
      - Working assets over documentation
      - Responding to feedback over following a plan
      - Continuous delivery over long cycles
    applies_when: "Managing evolving requirements"

  - domain: Supply Chain
    insight: |
      Asset production is a supply chain:
      - Dependencies matter (upstream affects downstream)
      - Bottlenecks limit throughput
      - Just-in-time vs batch has tradeoffs
      - Vendor management (AI tool selection) matters
    applies_when: "Optimizing production flow"
