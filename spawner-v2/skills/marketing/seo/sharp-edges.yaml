# The SEO mistakes that waste time or get penalized

sharp_edges:
  - id: keyword-stuffing
    summary: Unnaturally repeating keywords hoping to rank
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Same keyword appears 50 times on page. Awkward phrasing to fit keywords.
      Content reads like it was written for robots. Google notices. Rankings tank.
    why: |
      Google has been detecting keyword stuffing for over a decade. It triggers
      spam filters. Even if it worked briefly, algorithm updates will catch it.
      Write for humans, include keywords naturally.
    solution: |
      Natural keyword usage:

      1. Use keyword in title, H1, first paragraph
      2. Use variations and synonyms throughout
      3. Write naturally for humans
      4. If it sounds awkward, rewrite

      Density does not matter. Relevance does.
    symptoms:
      - Same phrase repeated excessively
      - Awkward phrasing
      - Content sounds robotic
      - Focus on keyword density

  - id: thin-content-scale
    summary: Publishing lots of low-quality pages for keyword coverage
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      1000 pages for 1000 keywords. Each page has 200 words. No real value.
      AI generated without review. Google sees thin content. Site authority tanks.
    why: |
      Google rewards depth over breadth. Thin content signals low quality. Many
      low-value pages hurt entire site authority. Better to have 50 excellent
      pages than 1000 mediocre ones.
    solution: |
      Content quality standards:

      1. Would you bookmark this page?
      2. Does it answer the query completely?
      3. Is there anything unique here?
      4. Would an expert approve?

      If no, do not publish.
    symptoms:
      - Many short pages
      - AI content without editing
      - Pages that exist for SEO only
      - Low time on page across site

  - id: link-buying
    summary: Purchasing backlinks instead of earning them
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Buying links from link farms. Paying for guest posts on low-quality sites.
      Private blog networks. Google detects. Manual penalty. Traffic goes to zero.
    why: |
      Google explicitly penalizes link schemes. Their algorithm is built to detect
      unnatural link patterns. When caught, recovery takes months or years. The
      risk is not worth it.
    solution: |
      Earn links instead:

      1. Create linkable assets (tools, research, guides)
      2. Digital PR for coverage
      3. Build relationships in industry
      4. Guest post on legitimate sites for audience, not links

      Quality over quantity always.
    symptoms:
      - Links from irrelevant sites
      - Paid link placements
      - Link velocity spikes
      - PBN usage

  - id: ignoring-technical-seo
    summary: Creating content on broken technical foundation
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Great content. Slow site. Mobile issues. Crawl errors. Google cannot
      index properly. Content never ranks despite quality. Technical issues
      undermine everything.
    why: |
      Technical SEO is the foundation. If Google cannot crawl and index your
      content, quality does not matter. If pages load slowly, users bounce.
      Fix technical issues first.
    solution: |
      Technical SEO checklist:

      1. Core Web Vitals passing
      2. Mobile friendly
      3. No crawl errors in Search Console
      4. Proper sitemap submitted
      5. Clean URL structure

      Content on solid foundation.
    symptoms:
      - Slow page loads
      - Mobile issues
      - Crawl errors
      - Good content not ranking
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: intent-mismatch
    summary: Creating content that does not match what searchers want
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Ranking for keyword. High impressions. Low clicks. Or clicks but high
      bounce. Content does not match what searcher actually wanted. Wrong
      format for intent.
    why: |
      Google measures user satisfaction. If users click and immediately bounce,
      your ranking will drop. Understanding intent is as important as keyword
      research.
    solution: |
      Intent matching process:

      1. Search the keyword yourself
      2. What format dominates results? (list, guide, video, product)
      3. What questions do snippets answer?
      4. Match your content to what ranks

      Intent first, then content.
    symptoms:
      - High impressions, low CTR
      - High bounce rate from search
      - Rankings declining over time
      - Wrong content format for keyword

  - id: no-content-refresh
    summary: Publishing content and never updating it
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Blog post from 2019 with outdated information. Screenshots of old UI.
      Advice that no longer applies. Google sees stale content. Rankings drop
      to competitors with fresh content.
    why: |
      Google favors freshness for many queries. Outdated content loses rankings
      over time. Your old posts compete with new competitors. Regular updates
      maintain and improve rankings.
    solution: |
      Content refresh cadence:

      1. Audit content quarterly
      2. Update statistics and examples
      3. Add new sections if topic evolved
      4. Update publish date when significantly changed

      Maintain your content library.
    symptoms:
      - Old content losing rankings
      - Outdated information live
      - No update schedule
      - Competitors publishing fresher content

  - id: chasing-volume
    summary: Targeting high-volume keywords you cannot rank for
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Targeting keyword with 100K monthly searches. Massive competition.
      Domain authority 20. Top results are DA 90. Never going to rank.
      Wasted effort.
    why: |
      High volume keywords have high competition. Without authority, you cannot
      compete. Better to rank 1 for 100-search keyword than rank 100 for
      100K-search keyword.
    solution: |
      Keyword difficulty assessment:

      1. Check top 10 DA/DR
      2. Compare to your authority
      3. Start with achievable keywords
      4. Build authority before targeting competitive terms

      Win where you can compete.
    symptoms:
      - Targeting keywords beyond reach
      - No rankings despite good content
      - Ignoring long-tail opportunities
      - Frustrated by lack of results

  - id: duplicate-content
    summary: Same content on multiple pages causing indexing issues
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Product pages with same description. Blog posts covering same topic.
      Multiple URLs for same content. Google confused about which to rank.
      Authority diluted across duplicates.
    why: |
      Duplicate content splits authority. Google picks one version, often not
      the one you want. Canonical tags solve some issues but unique content
      is better.
    solution: |
      Duplicate content prevention:

      1. Canonical tags on all pages
      2. Unique content on each page
      3. Consolidate similar pages
      4. Parameter handling in Search Console

      One page per topic.
    symptoms:
      - Multiple pages for same keyword
      - Canonical issues in Search Console
      - Wrong page ranking
      - Authority diluted

  - id: ignoring-search-console
    summary: Not using free data Google provides
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Search Console set up but never checked. Crawl errors accumulating.
      Manual actions unnoticed. Free keyword data unused. Flying blind
      when Google is showing you the way.
    why: |
      Search Console is free insight into how Google sees your site. Crawl
      errors, keyword rankings, click data. Ignoring it means missing problems
      and opportunities.
    solution: |
      Search Console routine:

      Weekly:
      - Check for crawl errors
      - Review coverage issues
      - Monitor click trends

      Monthly:
      - Analyze query data
      - Find quick win opportunities
      - Check Core Web Vitals

      Use the free data.
    symptoms:
      - Search Console ignored
      - Crawl errors unaddressed
      - Missing easy wins
      - No keyword insight

  - id: algorithm-chasing
    summary: Changing strategy with every Google update
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Google announces update. Panic. Change everything. Next update. Change
      again. Constant pivots based on SEO news. No consistent strategy.
    why: |
      Google updates reward fundamentals. Quality content, good UX, earned
      links. Chasing updates means chasing symptoms not causes. Build on
      fundamentals that survive all updates.
    solution: |
      Update-proof SEO:

      Focus on:
      - Genuinely helpful content
      - Fast, mobile-friendly site
      - Natural link profile
      - Good user experience

      These survive every update.
    symptoms:
      - Strategy changes after every update
      - Following SEO news obsessively
      - Short-term tactics
      - No consistent approach
