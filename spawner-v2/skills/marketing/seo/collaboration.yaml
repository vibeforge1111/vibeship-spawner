# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Information Retrieval
    insight: |
      IR researchers understand search:
      - Query-document matching (TF-IDF, BM25, embeddings)
      - Relevance signals (authority, freshness, engagement)
      - User behavior as feedback (clicks, dwell time, pogo-sticking)
      - Semantic understanding (entities, topic modeling, NLP)
      - Ranking algorithms (PageRank, learning to rank)
      SEO is applied information retrieval. Google's algorithms evolved
      from academic IR research. Understanding IR fundamentals reveals
      why certain tactics work.
    applies_when: "Understanding how search works"

  - domain: User Experience
    insight: |
      UX designers know user behavior:
      - Intent > demographics (task completion over personas)
      - Friction kills conversion (every click is a decision point)
      - Page speed matters (100ms delay = 1% conversion drop)
      - Mobile-first reality (60%+ of searches are mobile)
      - Clear hierarchy guides action (F-pattern, visual hierarchy)
      SEO is search UX. Google's algorithm increasingly rewards UX
      signals. Sites that users love, Google loves.
    applies_when: "Optimizing for user experience signals"

  - domain: Data Science
    insight: |
      Data scientists know analysis:
      - Correlation ≠ causation (backlinks correlate with rankings but aren't always cause)
      - Sample size matters (3 data points ≠ trend)
      - A/B test hypotheses (test one change at a time)
      - Track leading indicators (crawl rate before rankings)
      - Measure what matters (conversions > vanity metrics)
      SEO needs data rigor. Too many "SEO experts" confuse correlation
      with causation. Apply scientific method to SEO testing.
    applies_when: "Analyzing SEO performance"

  - domain: Competitive Intelligence
    insight: |
      CI analysts know competitors:
      - Gap analysis reveals opportunity (keywords they rank for, you don't)
      - Trends predict moves (topic clusters they're building)
      - Strengths can be flanked (don't compete head-on, find angles)
      - Weaknesses can be exploited (technical issues, outdated content)
      - Monitor continuously (Ahrefs alerts on competitor changes)
      SEO is competitive intelligence. Your rankings exist in context
      of competitors. Understand their strategy to beat them.
    applies_when: "Competitive SEO analysis"

  - domain: Information Architecture
    insight: |
      IA specialists know structure:
      - Taxonomy reflects user mental models (categories users understand)
      - Depth vs breadth tradeoffs (3 clicks to any page ideal)
      - Faceted navigation for complex content (filters that work)
      - Breadcrumbs aid navigation and SEO (show page hierarchy)
      - Internal linking distributes authority (hub and spoke model)
      SEO benefits from good IA. Clear site structure helps users and
      crawlers. IA is the skeleton; content is the muscle.
    applies_when: "Planning site structure and internal linking"

  - domain: Library Science
    insight: |
      Librarians know organization:
      - Controlled vocabularies (canonical terms for concepts)
      - Subject headings (topic clusters before they were cool)
      - Authority control (one source of truth per topic)
      - Metadata standards (structured data before Schema.org)
      - Cataloging principles (consistent classification)
      SEO borrows from library science. Topic clusters = subject headings.
      Pillar pages = reference works. Schema markup = cataloging metadata.
    applies_when: "Organizing content at scale"

  - domain: Behavioral Economics
    insight: |
      Behavioral economists know decision-making:
      - Anchoring affects perception (first result = trusted)
      - Social proof drives action (reviews, testimonials)
      - Scarcity creates urgency (limited time offer in snippet)
      - Default effect matters (position 1 gets 27% of clicks)
      - Loss aversion > gain seeking (fear of missing out works)
      SEO titles and descriptions leverage behavioral triggers.
      Understanding psychology improves CTR from search results.
    applies_when: "Writing meta titles and descriptions"

  - domain: Linguistics
    insight: |
      Linguists know language:
      - Semantic relationships (synonyms, related terms)
      - Natural language patterns (how people actually search)
      - Entity recognition (people, places, things)
      - Context determines meaning (disambiguation)
      - Language evolves (new terms, slang, industry jargon)
      Google's NLP (BERT, MUM) understands language like linguists.
      Write naturally, use semantic variations, match user language.
    applies_when: "Keyword research and content optimization"

  - Google Analytics (required)
  - Screaming Frog free (technical audits)
  - Manual SERP analysis (learn SEO thinking)

  When validated (traffic > 10K/mo):
  - Add paid tool: Ahrefs OR SEMrush (not both)
  - Consider content optimization: Clearscope OR Surfer

  When scaling (traffic > 100K/mo):
  - Full Ahrefs/SEMrush subscription
  - Content optimization platform
