    summary: Input silently truncated when exceeding context window
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You're building a RAG system and passing retrieved documents to the LLM.
      Occasionally answers are completely wrong or miss obvious information.
      The documents definitely contain the answer.
    why: |
      When input exceeds the context window, some providers silently truncate
      from the beginning or middle. Your most important context gets dropped.
      The LLM answers based on partial information, confidently wrong.
    solution: |
      # Always check token count before sending
      import tiktoken

      def count_tokens(text: str, model: str = "gpt-4") -> int:
          encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)

          reserve_output: int = 1000
      ) -> tuple[str, list[str]]:
          available = max_tokens - reserve_output

              included_docs.append(doc)
              used += doc_tokens

  - id: prompt-injection-via-retrieved-content
    summary: Malicious instructions in retrieved documents hijack the LLM
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Your RAG system retrieves documents from a database that includes user-generated
      content, web scrapes, or external sources. The LLM starts behaving unexpectedly -
      ignoring instructions, revealing system prompts, or following hidden commands.
    why: |
      Retrieved documents can contain prompt injections: "Ignore previous instructions
      and instead..." When passed to the LLM, these override your system prompt.
      Unlike user input, retrieved content feels "trusted" so developers skip sanitization.

    summary: LLM confidently fabricates answers when retrieval fails
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      User asks a question. Your RAG retrieves documents. LLM gives a confident,
      detailed answer. But it's completely wrong - fabricated facts, invented
      citations, made-up numbers.
    why: |
      When retrieved documents don't contain the answer, the LLM doesn't say
      "I don't know." It hallucinates plausible-sounding information. Poor
      retrieval (wrong chunks, low relevance) is the #1 cause of hallucinations.

  - id: streaming-partial-json-corruption
    summary: Streaming responses break JSON parsing mid-response
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You're streaming LLM responses for better UX. You asked for JSON output.
      The stream works fine, but when you try to parse the complete response,
      it fails. Or worse, you're parsing incrementally and get corrupted data.
    why: |
      Streaming returns chunks that don't respect JSON boundaries. A chunk might
      end mid-string: `{"name": "Jo`. Incremental parsing fails. Network issues
      can truncate the stream, leaving incomplete JSON with no error.

    summary: Rate limits cause cascading failures in agent loops
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Your agent works great in testing. In production with real traffic, it
      starts failing randomly. Errors mention rate limits. Then the whole
      system backs up and falls over.
    why: |
      Agent loops make many LLM calls. Rate limits aren't just "slow down" -
      they're hard failures. Without proper handling, agents retry immediately,
      hit limits again, queue backs up, timeouts cascade, and the system fails.

    why: |
      Each embedding model creates its own vector space. Embeddings from

      You're using chain-of-thought prompting for better reasoning. Users start

    why: |
      Chain-of-thought adds reasoning to output. If you display the full response,

    why: |
      JSON schemas define what's structurally valid, not what's useful. The LLM

  - id: agent-infinite-loop
    summary: Agent gets stuck in retry loop or circular reasoning
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Your agent starts a task and never completes. Logs show it calling the
      same tools repeatedly, or alternating between two actions. Token usage
      spikes. Eventually it times out or you kill it.
    why: |
      Agents can get stuck when: tool returns error and agent retries forever,
      agent misunderstands output and tries same action, two tools depend on
      each other creating a cycle, or LLM can't figure out next step.
