    summary: Unmeasured confounders invalidate causal estimates
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You run a causal analysis showing memory type X improves outcomes.
      You ship a feature prioritizing type X. No improvement in production.
      Turns out, expert users (confounder) both use type X and have better outcomes.
    why: |
      Observational data has confounders. If you don't measure and control for
      them, your "causal" effect is actually confounded association. No amount
      of sophisticated estimation fixes unmeasured confounding.
