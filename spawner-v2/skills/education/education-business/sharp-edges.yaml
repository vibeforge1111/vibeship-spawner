    symptoms:
      - Refund requests spike
      - Complaints about mismatch

    summary: Lowering price repeatedly, devaluing course
    severity: medium
    situation: Discounting more and more to get sales
    why: |
      Panic after slow sales.
      Competing on price.
      Imposter syndrome.
      Not addressing real issue.
    solution: |
      ## Escaping the Pricing Spiral

      ### Signs You're Spiraling
      - Regular deep discounts
      - "Sale" is permanent state
      - Price dropped multiple times
      - Competitors undercutting

      ### The Problem with Low Price
      - Attracts non-committed students
      - Lower completion rates
      - Harder to invest in quality
      - Can't afford to support students

      ### Recovery Path
      1. Stop discounting (cold turkey)
      2. Add value instead (bonuses)
      3. Create premium tier
      4. Reposition, don't re-price
      5. Gather testimonials at any price

      ### If Sales Are Slow
      | Instead of... | Do this... |
      |---------------|------------|
      | Lowering price | Add bonuses |
      | Permanent sale | Limited-time offer |
      | Competing on price | Differentiate on outcome |
    symptoms:
      - Price lower than last launch
      - "Always on sale"
      - Justifying with "it's accessible"
      - Competitors' prices driving yours
    detection_pattern: "lowered price|discount again|too expensive|cheaper"
