# Course Creation Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: scope-creep
    summary: Course keeps growing, never ships
    severity: high
    situation: Adding more content instead of launching
    why: |
      Perfectionism.
      Fear of criticism.
      "Just one more module."
      Comparing to comprehensive courses.
    solution: |
      ## Defeating Scope Creep

      ### The MVP Course
      - What's the MINIMUM to deliver the outcome?
      - Can you teach it in 4 modules? Try.
      - Save advanced content for Course 2.0

      ### Shipping Triggers
      | Signal | Action |
      |--------|--------|
      | 80% feels done | Ship it |
      | Adding "nice to haves" | Stop, ship |
      | Rewriting content | Stop, ship |
      | 3+ weeks past deadline | Ship now |

      ### Version Strategy
      - v1.0: Core transformation only
      - v1.1: Based on student feedback
      - v2.0: Expanded based on demand

      ### The "10 Students" Test
      Could 10 students get the outcome with what you have?
      - Yes → Ship
      - No → What's the ONE thing missing?
    symptoms:
      - Course has been "almost done" for months
      - Outline keeps expanding
      - Comparing to competitor courses
      - Waiting until it's "complete"
    detection_pattern: "not ready yet|one more|almost done|needs more"

  - id: curse-of-knowledge
    summary: Teaching above students' level
    severity: high
    situation: Expert can't remember what it's like to not know
    why: |
      Expert blind spots.
      Skipping "obvious" steps.
      Using jargon unconsciously.
      Assuming prerequisite knowledge.
    solution: |
      ## Overcoming Curse of Knowledge

      ### Detection
      - Have a beginner review your outline
      - Record yourself teaching, watch for skips
      - Ask: "What do they need to know BEFORE this?"

      ### Prevention
      | Technique | How |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Beginner reviewer | Have target student review |
      | Prerequisite list | Write out everything assumed |
      | Jargon glossary | Define every term |
      | Step recording | Write EVERY step, not just big ones |

      ### The "Explain to a 10-year-old" Test
      - Can you explain the concept simply?
      - No jargon allowed
      - If not, you don't understand it well enough

      ### Scaffolding Check
      For each lesson, ask:
      - What must they already know?
      - Is that covered earlier?
      - If not, add it or make it a prerequisite
    symptoms:
      - Students confused early on
      - Questions about "basic" concepts
      - High drop-off in early modules
      - Feedback mentions "too advanced"
    detection_pattern: "confused|lost|too fast|don't understand|over my head"

  - id: no-practice-opportunities
    summary: All content, no application
    severity: high
    situation: Students watch/read but never do
    why: |
      Easier to create content than exercises.
      Undervaluing practice.
      Thinking information = learning.
    solution: |
      ## Adding Practice Opportunities

      ### Practice Ratio
      Aim for: 40% content, 60% practice

      ### Practice Types
      | Type | When to Use |
      |------|-------------|
      | Reflection questions | After concepts |
      | Guided exercises | After demos |
      | Mini-projects | End of modules |
      | Capstone | End of course |

      ### The "Stop and Do" Method
      - Every 10-15 minutes of content
      - Insert a "now you try" moment
      - Even small actions beat passive watching

      ### Exercise Design
      1. Clear instructions
      2. Expected outcome
      3. Time estimate
      4. Example of "done"
      5. Common mistakes to avoid
    symptoms:
      - High watch time, low completion
      - Students can't apply knowledge
      - Positive feedback but no results
      - "Great content but..."
    detection_pattern: "watched but|didn't practice|couldn't apply|theory"

  - id: wrong-audience-level
    summary: Course targets wrong skill level
    severity: medium
    situation: Too basic or too advanced for actual audience
    why: |
      Didn't validate audience level.
      Assumed prerequisites.
      Tried to serve everyone.
    solution: |
      ## Right-Sizing Audience Level

      ### Pre-Launch Validation
      - Survey potential students
      - "What have you already tried?"
      - "What's your current skill level?"

      ### Clear Prerequisites
      - List explicitly in sales page
      - Include prerequisite check quiz
      - Offer bridge content if needed

      ### Segmentation Options
      | Situation | Solution |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Mixed levels | Beginner track + Advanced track |
      | Too basic | Add advanced bonuses |
      | Too advanced | Add foundation module |

      ### The "Before State" Interview
      Talk to 5 target students:
      - What do they already know?
      - Where are they stuck?
      - What have they tried?
    symptoms:
      - "This is too basic for me"
      - "I'm lost from the start"
      - Refund requests mentioning level
      - Bimodal completion rates
    detection_pattern: "too basic|too advanced|already knew|over my head"
