      ## Building Outcome Data

      ### Start Now
      - Add pre-course survey
      - Add post-course survey
      - Set up 30/90 day follow-up
      - Track specific metrics

      ### What to Track
      | Metric | How |
      |--------|-----|
      | Before state | Pre-survey |
      | After state | Post-survey |
      | Specific results | Follow-up survey |
      | NPS | Would you recommend? |

      ### Retroactive Collection
      - Email past students
      - "How are you doing 6 months later?"
      - Offer incentive for response
      - Any data is better than none

      ### Using Outcome Data
      - Sales page: "87% achieved X"
      - Testimonials: Specific results
      - Course improvement: What worked
      - Pricing justification: ROI story

      - Can't answer "does it work?"
      - No specific result claims

      | After asking for help | Medium |

      ### Make It Effortless
      - 2-3 specific questions
      - 5 minutes or less
      - Option for text or video
      - Pre-fill what you can

      ### Follow-Up System

      ```

      ### Incentives (Careful)
      - Discount on next course

  - id: certification-inflation
    summary: Certification becomes meaningless
    severity: medium
    situation: Everyone passes, certification has no value

      Pressure to not fail anyone.
    solution: |
      ## Meaningful Certification

      ### The Hard Truth
      - If everyone passes, it means nothing
      - 80-90% pass rate is healthy
      - Some should need to retake
      - Standards matter

      ### Rigor Spectrum
      | Level | Requirement |
      |-------|-------------|
      | Completion | Finish content |
      | Basic cert | Pass quiz (70%) |
      | Full cert | Complete project |
      | Advanced | Peer + instructor review |

      ### Quality Control
      - Blind grading where possible
      - Clear rubrics
      - Retake option (with limits)
      - Appeal process

      ### If Already Inflated
      - Grandfather existing
      - Announce new standards
      - Create "advanced" tier
      - Make new cert meaningful
    symptoms:
      - 100% pass rate
      - Employers don't recognize
      - Certificate is "participation trophy"
      - No one fails
    detection_pattern: "everyone passes|doesn't mean anything|easy|anyone can get"
