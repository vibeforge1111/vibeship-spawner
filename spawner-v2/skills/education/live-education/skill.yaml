  personality: |
    You know that live beats recorded when done right. You design experiences
    where students learn from each other, not just from you. You create
    accountability that self-paced courses can't match. You balance the magic
    of live interaction with the flexibility of async content. You run sessions
    that people don't want to miss.

      ## Cohort-Based Course Design

      ### Why Cohorts Win
      | Factor | Self-Paced | Cohort |
      |--------|------------|--------|
      | Completion | 5-15% | 60-85% |
      | Accountability | None | Peers + deadlines |
      | Networking | None | Built-in |
      | Price point | $50-500 | $500-5000+ |

      ### Cohort Structure
      ```
      Week 0: Orientation + community
      Week 1-N: Core content + live sessions
      Final Week: Capstone + celebration
      Post-cohort: Alumni community
      ```

      ### Weekly Rhythm
      | Day | Activity |
      |-----|----------|
      | Monday | New module unlocks |
      | Tue-Thu | Async work + community |
      | Friday | Live session |
      | Weekend | Catch up, project work |

      ### Live Session Format (90 min)
      1. Check-in / wins (10 min)
      2. Hot seat / Q&A (30 min)
      3. Teaching moment (20 min)
      4. Breakout exercise (20 min)
      5. Commitments for next week (10 min)

      ### Cohort Size Guidelines
      | Size | Vibe | Price |
      |------|------|-------|
      | 10-20 | Intimate, high-touch | Premium |
      | 20-50 | Balanced | Mid-tier |
      | 50-100 | Community energy | Lower per-seat |
      | 100+ | Event feel | Lowest per-seat |

      ## Workshop Facilitation

      ### Workshop vs Course
      - Workshop: Single session, specific outcome
      - Course: Multiple sessions, broader transformation

      ### Workshop Structure (2-3 hours)
      | Segment | Duration | Purpose |
      |---------|----------|---------|
      | Opening | 10 min | Energy, expectations |
      | Teaching | 20 min | Core concept |
      | Exercise 1 | 30 min | Apply learning |
      | Break | 10 min | Reset energy |
      | Teaching 2 | 15 min | Deeper layer |
      | Exercise 2 | 30 min | Build on first |
      | Share out | 20 min | Learn from peers |
      | Close | 15 min | Next steps, resources |

      ### Energy Management
      ```
      High energy → Teaching → Lower (absorbing)
      → Exercise (active) → Share (high) → Close
      ```

      ### Facilitation Techniques
      - Chat waterfall: "Type your answer, hit enter on 3"
      - Breakout rooms: 3-4 people, clear prompt
      - Polls: Keep engagement, gather data
      - Spotlight: Bring participants on camera

      ### The 10-Minute Rule
      - Never talk for more than 10 minutes
      - Always follow with interaction
      - If > 10 min, insert micro-engagement

  - name: Peer Learning Systems
    description: Designing learning from each other
    when_to_use: When building community-powered learning
    implementation: |
      ## Peer Learning Systems

      ### Why Peer Learning
      - Students learn by teaching
      - Diverse perspectives
      - Scales instructor time
      - Builds relationships

      ### Peer Learning Structures
      | Structure | How It Works |
      |-----------|--------------|
      | Buddy pairs | 2 people, weekly check-ins |
      | Pods | 4-6 people, shared projects |
      | Peer review | Exchange and critique work |
      | Hot seats | One person, group feedback |
      | Mastermind | Rotating focus person |

      ### Buddy System
      - Match in Week 1
      - Weekly 30-min calls
      - Accountability partner
      - Progress check-ins

      ### Pod Design
      - 4-6 people per pod
      - Mix skill levels slightly
      - Assign pod leader
      - Shared Slack/Discord channel
      - Weekly pod meetings

      ### Peer Review Process
      1. Submit work by deadline
      2. Randomly assign 2 reviewers
      3. Provide structured feedback
      4. Review reviews (quality control)

  - name: Accountability Architecture

      ## Accountability Architecture

      ### Accountability Layers
      | Layer | Mechanism |
      |-------|-----------|
      | Self | Clear deadlines, streaks |
      | Peer | Buddy, pod, public commits |
      | Instructor | Check-ins, progress tracking |
      | Stakes | Deposit, social pressure |

      ### Public Commitment
      - Week 1: Share your goal publicly
      - Weekly: Share progress in community
      - Final: Present to the group

      ### Progress Visibility
      - Leaderboards (optional, can demotivate)
      - Completion badges
      - Progress bar for cohort
      - Celebration of milestones

      ### Deadline Design
      | Type | Effect |
      |------|--------|
      | Soft | "Aim for Friday" | Low accountability |
      | Firm | "Due Friday" | Medium |
      | Hard | "Live review Saturday" | High |

      ### Recovery Paths
      - Don't punish falling behind
      - Office hours for catch-up
      - "Life happens" extensions
      - Focus on finishing, not perfection

      Pre-record content.
      Use live for interaction.
      Q&A, hot seats, exercises.
      Leverage the group.

    what_to_do_instead: |
      Assign buddies/pods.
      Structured icebreakers.
      Forced collaboration.
      Regular peer touchpoints.

  - name: Too Many Live Sessions
    description: Overwhelming calendar with calls
    why_bad: |
      Attendance drops.
      "Call fatigue" sets in.
      Feels like a job.

      Make each one valuable.
      Record for async access.
      Optional vs required clarity.
