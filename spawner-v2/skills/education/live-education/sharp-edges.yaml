  - id: low-attendance
    summary: Students stop showing up to live sessions
    severity: high
    situation: Attendance drops after first few sessions
    why: |
      Sessions not valuable enough.
      Wrong time for audience.
      Life gets in the way.
      Content could be async.
    solution: |
      ## Fixing Low Attendance

      ### Make Sessions Unmissable
      - Don't repeat recorded content
      - Hot seats / live coaching
      - Guest experts
      - Peer activities
      - Real-time feedback on their work

      ### Optimal Scheduling
      | Audience | Best Times |
      |----------|------------|
      | US professionals | Tue-Thu 12pm or 7pm ET |
      | Global | Rotate times or offer 2 |
      | Parents | After 8pm or during school |

      ### Attendance Boosters
      - Calendar invites with reminders
      - Day-before email
      - Morning-of Slack ping
      - Attendance tracking visible
      - Bonus for perfect attendance

      ### If They Miss
      - Recordings available (but not too convenient)
      - Buddy shares notes
      - Quick catch-up option
      - Don't guilt-trip
    symptoms:
      - Attendance drops week over week
      - Same people always missing
      - Low energy in sessions
      - Students watching recordings instead
    detection_pattern: "couldn't make it|watched recording|missed|low attendance"

  - id: silent-breakouts
    summary: Breakout rooms are awkward and unproductive
    severity: medium
    situation: Breakout sessions fail to generate engagement
    why: |
      Unclear instructions.
      No designated leader.
      Wrong group size.
      No accountability to share back.
    solution: |
      ## Effective Breakout Rooms

      ### Setup Rules
      - 3-4 people max per room
      - Written instructions on screen
      - Designate a "reporter"
      - Time-box clearly (with warning)

      ### Instruction Template
      ```
      In your breakout (10 min):
      1. Each person shares X (2 min each)
      2. Pick one to share with main room
      3. Elect a reporter to present
      ```

      ### Facilitation
      - Pop into rooms to check
      - Broadcast time warnings
      - Have backup plan for stragglers
      - Celebrate share-outs

      ### If Still Struggling
      - Start with pairs, then groups
      - Use collaborative docs
      - Give example of "good" response
      - Make it about their real work
    symptoms:
      - Silent breakout rooms
      - "We didn't know what to do"
      - Same people always talking
      - Nothing to share back
    detection_pattern: "awkward|silent|didn't know|what were we supposed to"

  - id: cohort-burnout
    summary: Running cohorts is exhausting and unsustainable
    severity: high
    situation: Instructor burns out after a few cohorts
    why: |
      Too much live time.
      Answering same questions.
      No team support.
      Emotional labor.
    solution: |
      ## Sustainable Cohort Operations

      ### Time Boundaries
      | Activity | Limit |
      |----------|-------|
      | Live sessions | 2-4 hrs/week |
      | Community | 30 min/day |
      | 1:1 coaching | Cap or eliminate |

      ### Leverage Others
      - Guest instructors
      - TA/community manager
      - Peer support structures
      - Alumni mentors

      ### Systematize Repetition
      - FAQ document
      - Recorded answers to common Qs
      - Templates for feedback
      - Standard operating procedures

      ### Recovery Between Cohorts
      - 2-4 week break between
      - Cohort retro and improvement
      - Batching cohorts (2x/year vs monthly)
    symptoms:
      - Dreading live sessions
      - Resentment building
      - Quality dropping
      - Considering quitting teaching
    detection_pattern: "exhausted|too much|burning out|need a break"

  - id: timezone-disasters
    summary: Global audience can't attend live sessions
    severity: medium
    situation: Major portions of audience excluded by timing
    why: |
      Single timezone focus.
      Didn't consider global reach.
      Can't please everyone.
    solution: |
      ## Timezone-Friendly Design

      ### Options
      | Approach | Trade-off |
      |----------|-----------|
      | Rotate times | Everyone inconvenienced equally |
      | Two sessions | More instructor time |
      | Regional cohorts | Smaller groups |
      | Async-first | Loses some live magic |

      ### Async-Heavy Model
      - 80% async content
      - 1 live session/week (rotates)
      - Recorded and shared quickly
      - Community for always-on support

      ### If Keeping Single Time
      - Be explicit in marketing
      - Show timezone clearly
      - Offer recording + notes
      - Create regional peer groups
    symptoms:
      - Complaints about timing
      - Large groups never attending
      - Refund requests citing timezone
      - Low engagement from regions
    detection_pattern: "timezone|too early|too late|can't attend|3am"
