      ## Avoiding Platform Lock-in

      ### Prevention
      - Evaluate export capabilities FIRST
      - Own your email list (outside platform)
      - Keep content in external format
      - Use platform-agnostic tools where possible

      ### Lock-in Warning Signs

      | Proprietary formats | High |
      | No API | High |
      | Community can't migrate | Medium |
      | Custom domain issues | Medium |

      ### If Already Locked In
      1. Export what you can now
      2. Build email list externally
      3. Document all content outside platform
      4. Plan migration for low-activity period
      5. Accept some data loss

      ### Portable Elements (Own These)
      - Email list (in ConvertKit, Mailchimp)
      - Content source files
      - Student testimonials
      - Brand assets
      - Your own domain
    symptoms:
      - "We can't leave because..."
      - Platform raising prices
      - Missing critical features
      - Competitors using better tools

      - [ ] Document current structure completely
      - [ ] Test import on new platform
      - [ ] Prepare student communication
      - [ ] Plan redirect strategy

      ### Migration Day
      - [ ] Choose low-traffic period
      - [ ] Have support on standby
      - [ ] Don't delete old platform yet
      - [ ] Monitor for issues
      - [ ] Be responsive to questions

      ### Post-Migration

      - [ ] Monitor support tickets
      - [ ] Keep old platform live 2-4 weeks

      ### Communicate Early and Often

      - 1 week before: What to expect
      - Day of: Here's what changed

  - id: shiny-platform-syndrome
    summary: Switching platforms for new features, not needs
    severity: medium
    situation: Frequent platform switching or evaluation
    why: |
      FOMO on new features.
      Competitor platform envy.
      Marketing to educators.
      Avoiding real work.
    solution: |
      ## Staying Focused

      ### Switch Criteria (2 of 4 needed)
      1. Missing feature that's costing real money
      2. Platform limiting growth significantly
      3. Support quality unacceptable
      4. Pricing no longer competitive

      ### "Good Enough" Principle
      - Perfect platform doesn't exist
      - Switching costs time and money
      - Students don't care about your platform
      - Focus on content, not tools

      ### Quarterly Review (Not More)
      - Is current platform blocking anything?
      - What would switching actually gain?
      - What's the true switching cost?
      - Decision: Stay or start migration
    symptoms:
      - Constantly researching platforms
      - Switching more than once/year
      - Grass-is-greener thinking
      - Procrastinating on course work
    detection_pattern: "have you tried|should we switch|new platform|better"
