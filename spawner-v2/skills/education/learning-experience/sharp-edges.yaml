  - id: completion-crisis
    summary: Course has very low completion rates
    severity: high
    situation: < 20% of students complete the course

      ## Fixing Low Completion

      ### Diagnose Drop-off Points
      1. Pull completion data by lesson
      2. Identify biggest drop-offs
      3. Analyze those specific lessons

      ### Quick Fixes
      | Issue | Fix |
      |-------|-----|
      | Long lessons | Split into 5-7 min chunks |
      | No progress | Add visual progress bar |
      | No urgency | Add optional deadlines |
      | No hook | Improve first lesson |

      ### Structural Fixes
      - Shorten overall course (cut 30%)
      - Add checkpoints/quizzes
      - Implement email sequences
      - Create peer accountability

      ### First Week Focus
      Students who complete week 1 are 4x more likely to finish.
      - Optimize first 3 lessons
      - Early win by day 3
      - Personal welcome message
      - Day 7 check-in email
    symptoms:
      - 80%+ students don't finish
      - Drop-off after lesson 1-3
      - Low activity after first week
      - Students say "I'll come back to it"
    detection_pattern: "didn't finish|haven't completed|dropped off|stopped"

    situation: Low engagement despite good curriculum
    why: |
      Talking head syndrome.

      - Visual variety (1-5)
