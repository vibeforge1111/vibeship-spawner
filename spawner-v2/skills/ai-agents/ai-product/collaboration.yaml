# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Cognitive Science
    insight: |
      Cognitive scientists know understanding:
      - Context shapes interpretation
      - Working memory is limited
      - Chunking aids processing
      - Expectations guide perception
      LLM prompting is applied cognitive science.
    applies_when: "Designing prompts and AI interactions"

  - domain: Probability Theory
    insight: |
      Statisticians know uncertainty:
      - Output is probabilistic, not deterministic
      - Temperature affects variance
      - Sampling has side effects
      - Confidence is not truth
      LLMs are probability machines.
    applies_when: "Building reliable AI features"

  - domain: Human-Computer Interaction
    insight: |
      HCI researchers know trust:
      - Transparency builds trust
      - Errors erode trust fast
      - Expectations must be set
      - Fallbacks preserve experience
      AI trust follows HCI principles.
    applies_when: "Designing AI user experience"
