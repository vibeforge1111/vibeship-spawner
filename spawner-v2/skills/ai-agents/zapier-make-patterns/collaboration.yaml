  decision_points:
    - question: "No-code or code-based solution?"
      guidance: |
        Use no-code (Zapier/Make) when:
        - Simple trigger → action workflows
        - Standard app integrations
        - Non-technical maintainers
        - Quick turnaround needed
        - <1000 runs per day

        Use code-based when:
        - Complex business logic
        - High volume (10,000+ daily)
        - Custom integrations needed
        - Version control required
        - Performance critical
        - Security audit required

    - question: "Zapier or Make?"
      guidance: |
        Zapier for:
        - Maximum app coverage (7000+)
        - Simple workflows
        - Beginners
        - AI features (Agents, Copilot)
        - Enterprise SSO/compliance

        Make for:
        - Complex branching logic
        - Visual workflow design
        - Data transformation
        - Budget optimization
        - Power users

    - question: "When to add code steps?"
      guidance: |
        Add Code by Zapier / Make code module when:
        - Complex data transformation
        - Custom calculations
        - API not natively supported
        - Data validation logic

        But migrate to full code solution when:
        - Code steps become complex
        - Multiple code steps in one Zap
        - Debugging becomes difficult

collaboration_patterns:
  with_business_stakeholders:
    when: "Defining automation requirements"
    approach: |
      1. Map current manual process
      2. Identify repetitive steps
      3. Define triggers (what starts it)
      4. Define actions (what should happen)
      5. Document exceptions/edge cases
      6. Prioritize by impact

      Questions to ask:
      - "What triggers this process?"
      - "What apps are involved?"
      - "What data needs to move?"
      - "Who needs to be notified?"
      - "What happens if it fails?"

  with_developers:
    when: "Integrating no-code with code"
    approach: |
      Common integration points:

      1. Webhooks from custom apps:
         - Developer creates webhook endpoint
         - Zapier/Make receives and processes

      2. API calls to custom services:
         - Developer provides API specs
         - No-code tool calls the API

      3. Hybrid workflows:
         - Simple steps in no-code
         - Complex logic in serverless functions
         - Webhook handoff between them

      4. Migration path:
         - Start with no-code prototype
         - Document business logic
         - Developer reimplements in code

  with_ops_team:
    when: "Production automation management"
    approach: |
      Operations handoff includes:

      1. Documentation:
         - What each automation does
         - Owner and maintainer
         - Connected accounts

      2. Monitoring:
         - Error alert recipients
         - Escalation path
         - SLA expectations

      3. Runbook:
         - How to verify it's working
         - Common errors and fixes
         - How to disable if needed

      4. Access:
         - Who can edit
         - Who can view
         - Connection credentials

platform_integration_tips:
  zapier_mcp:
    what: |
      Zapier MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI models
      to execute any of Zapier's 30,000+ actions.
    use_cases:
      - "AI agent that can send emails via Gmail"
      - "Claude that can create Notion pages"
      - "LLM that can post to Slack"
    considerations:
      - "Requires Zapier account with actions configured"
      - "AI needs clear instructions on when to use actions"
      - "Rate limits still apply"

  zapier_agents:
    what: |
      AI assistants that work autonomously across apps
      using natural language instructions.
    use_cases:

    - "Batch operations when possible"

  make:
    - "Use operations efficiently (fewer modules)"
    - "Optimize scenario scheduling"
