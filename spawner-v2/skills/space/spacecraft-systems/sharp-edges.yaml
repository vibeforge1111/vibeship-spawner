    severity: critical
    title: "Reaction Wheel Saturation Causes Loss of Control"
    summary: "Wheels absorb momentum until they can't spin faster"
    symptoms:
      - "Pointing accuracy degrades"
      - "Wheels at maximum speed"
      - "Spacecraft begins tumbling"
    why: |
      Reaction wheels absorb angular momentum from disturbances (gravity
      gradient, solar pressure, magnetic). They spin faster to compensate.
      Eventually they hit max speed and can't absorb more - you lose control.
    gotcha: |
      "Spacecraft is drifting off target"
      "Wheels are at 6000 RPM"
      "Maximum is 6000 RPM"
      "We forgot to plan momentum dumping"

      # External torques: ~1e-6 Nm typical, adds up over orbits
    solution: |
      1. Plan momentum management:
         - Calculate secular momentum buildup
         - Size wheel momentum capacity for dump interval
         - Allocate time for desaturation

      2. Dumping methods:
         - Magnetorquers (LEO, continuous)
         - Thrusters (any orbit, uses propellant)
         - Gravity gradient (specific orientations)

      3. Monitor and act:
         - Track wheel speeds in telemetry
         - Automatic desaturation triggers
         - Safe mode if approaching limits

  - id: battery-deep-discharge
    severity: critical
    title: "Deep Battery Discharge Kills Capacity"
    summary: "Discharging below 70% SOC accelerates degradation"
    symptoms:
      - "Battery capacity decreasing over time"
      - "Eclipse duration margins shrinking"
      - "Mission life shortened"
    why: |
      Li-ion batteries degrade faster with deep discharge cycles.
      Rated for 50000 cycles at 30% DOD, but only 5000 cycles at 80% DOD.
      Each eclipse counts as a cycle. Deeper discharge = shorter life.
    gotcha: |
      "Battery was sized for 1-hour eclipse at 80% DOD"
      "After 2 years, capacity is down 40%"
      "We can't survive full eclipses anymore"
      "Should have sized for 30% DOD"

      # 30% DOD = 50000 cycles, 80% DOD = 5000 cycles
    solution: |
      1. Size conservatively:
         - Design for 30% DOD maximum
         - Include degradation in sizing
         - Account for cell imbalance

      2. Thermal management:
         - Battery operates best at 10-25C
         - Avoid thermal cycling
         - Dedicated thermal control

      3. Monitor health:
         - Track capacity vs prediction
         - Cell voltage monitoring
         - End-of-life planning

  - id: star-tracker-blinding
    severity: high
    title: "Star Tracker Blinded by Sun/Moon/Earth"
    summary: "Bright objects in FOV prevent attitude determination"
    symptoms:
      - "Star tracker reports no solution"
      - "Attitude accuracy degrades"
      - "Occurs at certain orbit positions"
    why: |
      Star trackers image stars to determine attitude. Sun, Moon, or
      Earth limb in the FOV saturates the detector. The tracker can't
      see stars and loses its attitude solution.
    gotcha: |
      "Star tracker 1 went blind"
      "Switch to tracker 2"
      "Both trackers are pointed the same direction"
      "Both are blinded by Earth"

      # Sun: always avoid, Moon: predictable, Earth: depends on orientation
    solution: |
      1. Multiple trackers:
         - Different boresight directions
         - Can always see stars in some direction
         - Typically 2-3 trackers

      2. Exclusion zones:
         - Define Sun/Moon/Earth avoidance
         - ~30-40 deg exclusion typical
         - Mission planning for geometry

      3. Fallback sensors:
         - Sun sensors for coarse attitude
         - Gyro propagation during blind periods
         - Magnetometer for LEO

  - id: single-point-power-failure
    severity: high
    title: "Single Power Bus Failure Kills Spacecraft"
    summary: "Power system has no redundancy path"
    symptoms:
      - "One component failure causes total loss"
      - "No way to isolate failed element"
      - "Cannot shed loads to survive"
    why: |
      Power is required by everything. A single power bus design means
      one failure (short, open, regulator) can take out the entire
      spacecraft. No power = no communication = mission lost.
    gotcha: |
      "Solar array string shorted"
      "It pulled down the whole bus"
      "We couldn't isolate it"
      "Spacecraft went silent"

      # Power anomalies are leading cause of spacecraft failures
    solution: |
      1. Redundant architecture:
         - Multiple solar array strings
         - Cross-strapped batteries
         - Redundant regulators

      2. Protection:
         - Current limiters
         - Fuses or circuit breakers
         - Autonomous load shedding

      3. Safe mode power:
         - Minimum configuration survives
         - Critical loads always powered
         - Can communicate for recovery

  - id: thermal-snap-structural
    severity: high
    title: "Thermal Snap Causes Structural Damage"
    summary: "Rapid temperature change stresses structure beyond limits"
    symptoms:
      - "Cracking sounds in telemetry"
      - "Misalignment of components"
      - "Solar array deployment issues"
    why: |
      Eclipse entry/exit causes rapid temperature changes. Different
      materials expand/contract at different rates. Large temperature
      gradients create stress. This can crack structures or cause
      permanent deformation.
    gotcha: |
      "Solar array won't deploy fully"
      "Mechanism binding"
      "It worked fine before eclipse"
      "Thermal gradient distorted the hinge"

      # Temperature change can be 100+ degrees in minutes
    solution: |
      1. Design for thermal environment:
         - CTE matching for bonded joints
         - Flexible connections where needed
         - Thermal analysis of gradients

      2. Slow transitions:
         - Heater pre-conditioning
         - Attitude maneuvers to reduce gradient
         - Operational procedures

      3. Test:
         - Thermal vacuum testing
         - Multiple cycles
         - Include mechanisms in test
