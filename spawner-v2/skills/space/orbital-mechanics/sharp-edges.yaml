    title: "Two-Body Propagation Fails for LEO"
    summary: "Ignoring J2 causes km-level errors in hours"
    symptoms:
      - "Predicted position differs from actual by kilometers"
      - "Satellite not where expected during pass"
      - "Collision avoidance calculations wrong"
    why: |
      Earth's oblateness (J2) causes RAAN to drift ~7 deg/day for typical LEO.
      Two-body assumes spherical Earth. After one day, your predicted orbital
      plane can be wrong by degrees - that's hundreds of km in position.
    gotcha: |
      "The satellite should be over Europe"
      "It's over Africa"
      "We propagated for 24 hours with Keplerian elements"
      "But Earth isn't a sphere"

      # J2 causes ~7 deg/day RAAN drift at ISS altitude
    solution: |
      1. Always include J2 for LEO:
         - Use at minimum J2 secular rates
         - Better: full J2 in numerical propagation
         - Best: J2-J6 + drag + solar pressure

      2. Know your error growth:
         - Two-body: km/day error for LEO
         - J2 only: 100m/day error
         - Full model: cm-level possible

      3. Use appropriate tools:
         - SGP4/SDP4 for TLE propagation
         - GMAT/STK for precision work

    severity: high
    title: "Plane Change at Wrong Location Wastes Delta-V"
    summary: "Plane changes at periapsis cost 2x more than at apoapsis"
    symptoms:
      - "Excessive fuel consumption"
      - "Shorter mission life than planned"
      - "Maneuver sequence seems inefficient"
    why: |
      Delta-v for plane change is proportional to velocity: dv = 2*v*sin(di/2).
      Velocity is highest at periapsis, lowest at apoapsis. Same inclination
      change costs much more at periapsis.
    gotcha: |
      "We need to change inclination by 10 degrees"
      "Let's do it at periapsis, we're there anyway"
      "That cost 500 m/s!"
      "At apoapsis it would have been 200 m/s"

      # v_periapsis / v_apoapsis can be 2x or more
    solution: |
      1. Plan plane changes at apoapsis:
         - Velocity is lowest
         - Delta-v is minimized
         - Worth waiting half an orbit

      2. Combined maneuvers:
         - If raising orbit AND changing plane
         - Do both at same point
         - Vector sum is less than separate burns

      3. Analysis:
         - Calculate both options
         - Factor in mission constraints
         - Sometimes timing matters more than fuel

    severity: high
    title: "Kepler Equation Solver Diverges"
    summary: "Newton-Raphson fails for high eccentricity with poor initial guess"
    symptoms:
      - "Solver throws convergence error"
      - "NaN in orbital calculations"
      - "Highly elliptical orbits fail to propagate"
    why: |
      The Kepler equation M = E - e*sin(E) is solved iteratively. For high
      eccentricity, the function has steep regions. A poor initial guess
      can cause Newton-Raphson to diverge or oscillate.
    gotcha: |
      "Propagation works for circular orbits"
      "But crashes for Molniya orbit (e=0.74)"
      "Newton-Raphson diverged"
      "Initial guess E=M doesn't work for high e"

      # Need E=pi as initial guess when e > 0.8
    solution: |
      1. Adaptive initial guess:
         - e < 0.8: E_0 = M
         - e >= 0.8: E_0 = pi
         - Or use series expansion for first guess

      2. Robust solver:
         - Limit maximum iterations
         - Use bisection as fallback
         - Consider Laguerre's method

      3. Test edge cases:
         - e = 0 (circular)
         - e = 0.9 (highly elliptical)
         - e approaching 1 (near-parabolic)

  - id: patched-conic-boundary-errors
    severity: high
    title: "Patched Conic SOI Transition Errors"
    summary: "Discontinuities at sphere of influence boundaries"
    symptoms:
      - "Trajectory jumps at planetary arrival"
      - "Energy not conserved across transition"
      - "Capture calculations wrong"
    why: |
      Patched conic is an approximation - we switch gravity sources at the
      sphere of influence (SOI). In reality, both bodies pull simultaneously.
      The transition introduces discontinuities in trajectory.
    gotcha: |
      "Our Mars capture delta-v was calculated as 900 m/s"
      "Actual capture required 1100 m/s"
      "The patched conic transition added error"
      "We should have used higher fidelity at the boundary"

      # SOI is just a convention, not a physical boundary
    solution: |
      1. Understand the approximation:
         - SOI is where gravitational influences are roughly equal
         - Not a sharp boundary
         - Error is inherent to method

      2. Add margins:
         - 10-20% delta-v margin for captures
         - More for low-altitude captures
         - Less for high flybys

      3. Higher fidelity when needed:
         - Full N-body for critical phases
         - Restricted three-body for libration points
         - Monte Carlo for uncertainty

  - id: wrong-anomaly-type
    severity: medium
    title: "Mixing Up Anomaly Types"
    summary: "Using true anomaly where mean anomaly expected or vice versa"
    symptoms:
      - "Position calculations completely wrong"
      - "Time-of-flight calculations incorrect"
      - "Rendezvous timing errors"
    why: |
      Three anomaly types exist: Mean (M), Eccentric (E), True (nu).
      They're related but NOT interchangeable. Mean anomaly increases
      linearly with time. True anomaly is actual angle from periapsis.
      For eccentric orbits, they differ significantly.
    gotcha: |
      "Spacecraft position is 45 degrees from periapsis"
      "That's the true anomaly"
      "But we used it as mean anomaly for propagation"
      "Now timing is off by hours"

      # At e=0.5, true anomaly 90 deg = mean anomaly 63 deg
    solution: |
      1. Be explicit about anomaly type:
         - nu = true anomaly (geometric angle)
         - E = eccentric anomaly (auxiliary)
         - M = mean anomaly (linear in time)

      2. Convert correctly:
         - M -> E: Solve Kepler equation
         - E -> nu: tan(nu/2) = sqrt((1+e)/(1-e))*tan(E/2)
         - Know which your tools expect

      3. Verify with sanity checks:
         - M=E=nu=0 at periapsis
         - M=E=nu=pi at apoapsis
         - For circular orbits, all equal
