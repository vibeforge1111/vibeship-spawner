    severity: critical
    title: "Stale TLE Causes Missed Passes"
    summary: "Predictions diverge from reality as TLE ages"
    symptoms:
      - "Satellite not acquired at predicted AOS"
      - "Antenna searching but no signal"
      - "Pass shorter than predicted"
    why: |
      TLE (Two-Line Element) sets have built-in epoch time. Prediction
      accuracy degrades with age. For LEO, a TLE >3 days old can have
      km-level errors. The satellite isn't where you think it is.
    gotcha: |
      "Antenna is tracking the predicted position"
      "But no signal at AOS"
      "When was the TLE updated?"
      "A week ago"

      # LEO TLE: update daily, GEO: weekly okay
    solution: |
      1. Fresh TLEs:
         - LEO: Update daily minimum
         - MEO/GEO: Update weekly
         - Get from Space-Track.org

      2. Prediction monitoring:
         - Compare actual AOS to predicted
         - Track systematic errors
         - Flag when TLE is stale

      3. Acquisition margins:
         - Start tracking before predicted AOS
         - Use search pattern if needed
         - Allow for prediction uncertainty

  - id: command-without-verification
    severity: critical
    title: "Commanding Without Verification"
    summary: "Wrong command sent without checking echo"
    symptoms:
      - "Spacecraft in unexpected state"
      - "Command log doesn't match intent"
      - "Operator error propagated to spacecraft"
    why: |
      Commands can be mistyped, selected incorrectly, or corrupted in
      transmission. Without verifying the command echo (what the
      spacecraft received), you don't know what was actually executed.
    gotcha: |
      "I sent the attitude maneuver command"
      "But the spacecraft is spinning"
      "The parameter was wrong - 100 deg instead of 10 deg"
      "We didn't check the echo before execution"

      # Command errors are a leading cause of spacecraft anomalies
    solution: |
      1. Mandatory verification:
         - Always check command echo
         - Compare to intended parameters
         - Block execution until verified

      2. Two-person rule:
         - Second operator confirms
         - Required for critical commands
         - Audit trail of both authorizations

      3. Constraint checking:
         - Automated prerequisite verification
         - Range/limit checking on parameters
         - State machine validation

  - id: rain-fade-loss
    severity: high
    title: "Rain Fade Causes Critical Contact Loss"
    summary: "Atmospheric attenuation drops link during rain"
    symptoms:
      - "Link margin degrades during pass"
      - "Data errors increase"
      - "Contact lost before LOS"
    why: |
      Rain absorbs and scatters RF energy, especially at higher
      frequencies (Ka-band: 3-10 dB loss, X-band: 1-3 dB).
      A link designed with 3 dB margin can fail in moderate rain.
    gotcha: |
      "We lost the link at 45 degrees elevation"
      "Should have been fine until 10 degrees"
      "It started raining during the pass"
      "Our Ka-band link couldn't handle it"

      # Ka-band very sensitive, S-band nearly immune
    solution: |
      1. Design for weather:
         - Extra margin for rain (location-dependent)
         - Lower frequency backup (X instead of Ka)
         - Diversity sites

      2. Weather awareness:
         - Monitor forecasts
         - Real-time attenuation sensing
         - Adaptive data rates

      3. Operations:
         - Critical activities during clear weather
         - Backup scheduling
         - Rain rate statistics for site

  - id: data-overflow-loss
    severity: high
    title: "Data Overflow Due to Insufficient Contact"
    summary: "On-board recorder fills faster than data can be downlinked"
    symptoms:
      - "Data recorder approaching full"
      - "Oldest data being overwritten"
      - "Science data lost"
    why: |
      Spacecraft generate data continuously but can only downlink during
      contacts. If generation rate exceeds average downlink capacity,
      the recorder fills up. Then you lose data.
    gotcha: |
      "Payload generated 10 GB today"
      "We only had one 8-minute pass"
      "Downlinked 500 MB"
      "9.5 GB waiting, but recorder is only 5 GB"

      # Average generation must be < average downlink
    solution: |
      1. Budget data volume:
         - Calculate daily generation
         - Calculate daily downlink capacity
         - Verify positive margin

      2. Prioritization:
         - Mark data by priority
         - Oldest-first or priority-first
         - Don't overwrite critical data

      3. Operations:
         - More ground stations
         - Higher data rate mode
         - Reduce payload duty cycle

  - id: wrong-spacecraft-command
    severity: critical
    title: "Command Sent to Wrong Spacecraft"
    summary: "Multi-satellite constellation command routing error"
    symptoms:
      - "Commanded satellite doesn't respond"
      - "Different satellite executes command"
      - "Constellation coordination broken"
    why: |
      With multiple satellites, each has a unique address. If the
      ground system isn't correctly configured, or operator selects
      wrong target, commands go to unintended spacecraft.
    gotcha: |
      "SAT-1 didn't execute the maneuver"
      "But SAT-2 is now in wrong orbit"
      "The command routing was set to SAT-2"
      "We commanded the wrong satellite"

      # Constellation operations require rigorous ID checking
    solution: |
      1. Configuration management:
         - Unique spacecraft identifiers
         - Session-based target locking
         - Visual confirmation of target

      2. Verification:
         - Spacecraft echoes include ID
         - Cross-check before execution
         - Telemetry from correct satellite

      3. Automation:
         - Scheduler sets correct target
         - Procedure includes ID verification
         - Block cross-routing
