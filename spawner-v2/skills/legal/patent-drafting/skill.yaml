description: Use when drafting patent applications, writing claims, analyzing prior art, or responding to office actions - covers USPTO practice, claim strategies, and specification requirements

patterns:
  golden_rules:
    - rule: "Claim first, then spec"
      reason: "Claims define what you protect"
    - rule: "One chance for specification"
      reason: "Can't add new matter later"
    - rule: "Antecedent basis"
      reason: "Every claim term must be introduced"
    - rule: "Means-plus-function = narrow"
      reason: "Tied to spec + equivalents only"
    - rule: "Dependent claims = fallback"
      reason: "If independent fails, dependents may survive"

  application_structure:
    - "Title - Concise, descriptive"
    - "Abstract - 150-word summary"
    - "Background - Prior art limitations"
    - "Summary - Invention overview"
    - "Drawings - Figures + reference numbers"
    - "Detailed Description - Enable one of skill"
    - "Claims - Legal scope of protection"

  claim_categories:
    method: "A method of processing data..."
    system: "A system comprising: processor, memory..."
    apparatus: "An apparatus for measuring..."
    crm: "A non-transitory computer-readable medium..."
    product_by_process: "A widget produced by the method of claim 1"

  transitional_phrases:
    comprising: "OPEN - Allows additional unlisted elements (preferred)"
    consisting_of: "CLOSED - Excludes additional elements"
    consisting_essentially_of: "PARTIALLY OPEN - Rarely used"

  patentability_tests:
    novelty_102: "ALL elements in ONE reference = anticipated"
    obviousness_103: "Elements known + motivation to combine = obvious"

anti_patterns:
  - pattern: "Too narrow claims"
    problem: "Easy to design around"
    solution: "Start broad, add fallbacks"
  - pattern: "Missing antecedent"
    problem: "112(b) rejection"
    solution: "Track every 'the' reference"
  - pattern: "Means-plus-function"
    problem: "Narrow to spec embodiments"
    solution: "Use structural language"
  - pattern: "No dependent claims"
    problem: "No fallback if independent fails"
    solution: "3-5 dependents per independent"
  - pattern: "Spec too brief"
    problem: "Enablement rejection"
    solution: "Include alternatives and examples"
  - pattern: "Jargon without definition"
    problem: "Indefiniteness"
    solution: "Define all technical terms"

implementation_checklist:
  claims:
    - "Draft independent claims first (method, system, CRM)"
    - "Use 'comprising' as default transitional phrase"
    - "Verify antecedent basis for all claim terms"
    - "Add 3-5 dependent claims per independent"
    - "Check for means-plus-function triggers"
  specification:
    - "Include at least one concrete example"
    - "Describe alternative embodiments"
    - "Define all technical terms"
    - "Enable one of ordinary skill"
  prior_art:
    - "Conduct prior art search before filing"
    - "Review claims against specification for support"
    - "Identify distinguishing features"
  review:
    - "Get inventor sign-off on technical accuracy"
    - "Verify no hidden means-plus-function"
    - "Check claim-specification consistency"
