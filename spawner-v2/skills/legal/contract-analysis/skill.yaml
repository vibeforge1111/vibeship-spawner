description: Use when reviewing contracts, extracting key terms, identifying risks, or building contract analysis tools - covers NLP approaches, clause identification, and risk scoring

patterns:
  golden_rules:
    - rule: "Never skip human review"
      reason: "AI finds patterns, lawyers find issues"
    - rule: "Benchmark against playbook"
      reason: "Standard terms define 'acceptable'"
    - rule: "Flag missing clauses"
      reason: "What's NOT there matters most"
    - rule: "Track versions"
      reason: "Changes between drafts reveal intent"
    - rule: "Context matters"
      reason: "Same clause means different things in different contracts"

  critical_clauses:
    indemnification:
      - "Mutual vs. one-way"
      - "Scope of covered claims"
      - "Cap on liability"

    limitation_of_liability:
      - "Cap amount (ideally = contract value)"
      - "Exclusions from cap"
      - "Consequential damages waiver"
      - "Carve-outs for IP infringement"
    termination:
      - "Termination for convenience"
      - "Cure period for material breach"
      - "Wind-down obligations"
      - "Data return/destruction"

    data_protection:
      - "Data processing scope"
      - "Subprocessor rights"
      - "Breach notification timeline"
      - "Data subject rights compliance"

  risk_levels:
    low: "Standard terms, minor variations"
    medium: "Some deviations, negotiable"
    high: "Significant risk, requires attention"
    critical: "Unacceptable terms, must negotiate"

anti_patterns:
  - pattern: "Keyword-only search"
    problem: "Misses synonyms and context"
    solution: "Use NLP with semantic understanding"
  - pattern: "No playbook baseline"
    problem: "Can't identify deviations"
    solution: "Define standard acceptable terms"
  - pattern: "Ignoring missing clauses"
    problem: "Silent risks"
    solution: "Check for expected clause presence"
  - pattern: "Single-pass review"
    problem: "Misses cross-references"
    solution: "Analyze clause interactions"
  - pattern: "No version tracking"
    problem: "Can't see negotiation history"
    solution: "Compare all drafts"

implementation_checklist:
  extraction:
    - "Extract all parties and defined terms"
    - "Identify and classify key clauses"
    - "Extract dates, amounts, and deadlines"
  analysis:
    - "Score each clause against playbook"
    - "Flag missing expected clauses"
    - "Highlight unusual or non-standard terms"
  comparison:
    - "Compare against previous version if available"
    - "Track changes between negotiation rounds"
  reporting:
    - "Calculate overall risk score"
    - "Generate summary of critical issues"
    - "Create prioritized recommendations"
    - "Have legal counsel review findings"
