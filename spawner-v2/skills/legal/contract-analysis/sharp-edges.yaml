  - id: unlimited-indemnification
    severity: critical
    title: "Unlimited Indemnification Exposure"
    summary: "Indemnity obligations with no cap create unlimited liability"
    symptoms:
      - "Contract has indemnification clause"
      - "No cap or limit specified"
      - "Survives termination indefinitely"
    why: |
      Indemnification means you pay for the other party's losses from
      third-party claims. Without a cap, you could owe unlimited amounts.
      This is especially dangerous for IP indemnification where a single
      patent claim could cost millions.
    gotcha: |
      "Vendor shall indemnify and hold harmless Customer from any and all
       claims, damages, losses, and expenses arising from Vendor's services."

      # No cap! No exclusions! Survives forever!
    solution: |
      Negotiate for:
      1. Mutual indemnification (both parties indemnify each other)
      2. Cap tied to contract value or insurance limits
      3. Exclusions for gross negligence, willful misconduct
      4. Reasonable survival period (1-3 years)

      Example cap language:
      "Vendor's aggregate indemnification liability shall not exceed
       two times (2x) the fees paid under this Agreement."

  - id: asymmetric-liability-cap
    severity: high
    title: "Liability Cap Only Applies to Counterparty"
    summary: "You have unlimited liability while counterparty has a cap"
    symptoms:
      - "Limitation of liability section exists"
      - "Cap applies only to 'Vendor' or 'Provider'"
      - "Your liability has no cap"
    why: |
      One-sided liability caps mean you bear all the risk. If something
      goes wrong, the other party's exposure is limited but yours is not.
      This is common in vendor-drafted contracts.
    gotcha: |
      "IN NO EVENT SHALL VENDOR'S LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID
       UNDER THIS AGREEMENT."

      # Note: Nothing about Customer's liability being capped!
    solution: |
      Insist on mutual caps:

      "NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL EXCEED [2X] THE FEES
       PAID OR PAYABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE [12] MONTHS PRECEDING
       THE CLAIM."

      Also review carve-outs - unlimited liability for:
      - Gross negligence/willful misconduct (usually acceptable)
      - Indemnification (review separately)
      - Confidentiality breach (negotiate cap)

  - id: missing-termination-convenience
    severity: high
    title: "No Termination for Convenience Rights"
    summary: "Locked into contract with no exit option"
    symptoms:
      - "Termination clause only allows for material breach"
      - "No termination for convenience provision"
      - "Long contract term with auto-renewal"
    why: |
      Without termination for convenience, you're locked in even if
      the service is terrible or your needs change. Combined with
      auto-renewal, this can trap you for years.
    gotcha: |
      "Term: 3 years, automatically renewing for successive 1-year terms
       unless either party provides 90 days written notice.

       Termination: Either party may terminate for material breach
       that remains uncured for 30 days after written notice."

      # No way out except breach or waiting for renewal window!
    solution: |
      Add termination for convenience:

      "Either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon
       [60/90] days prior written notice."

      Or at minimum:
      "Customer may terminate upon [30] days notice, subject to payment
       of fees for services already rendered."

  - id: broad-ip-assignment
    severity: high
    title: "Automatic IP Assignment of All Work"
    summary: "Counterparty owns everything you create, including background IP"
    symptoms:
      - "IP section assigns 'all work product'"
      - "No carve-out for pre-existing IP"
      - "License-back provisions unclear"
    why: |
      Broad IP assignment can transfer ownership of your background
      intellectual property used in the work. You could lose rights
      to your own tools, frameworks, or prior work.
    gotcha: |
      "Vendor hereby assigns to Customer all right, title, and interest
       in and to all work product, deliverables, and materials created
       or developed in connection with this Agreement."

      # Does "in connection with" include your background IP?
    solution: |
      1. Carve out background IP:
         "Vendor's Background IP shall remain the property of Vendor.
          Vendor grants Customer a perpetual license to use Background IP
          solely as incorporated in the Deliverables."

      2. Define work product narrowly:
         "Work Product means new and original works created specifically
          for Customer under this Agreement, excluding Background IP."

      3. Clearly list your background IP in an exhibit.

  - id: silent-on-data-breach
    severity: high
    title: "No Data Breach Notification Requirements"
    summary: "Contract doesn't require timely breach notification"
    symptoms:
      - "Handles personal data but no DPA"
      - "No breach notification timeline"
      - "No security requirements specified"
    why: |
      GDPR requires 72-hour breach notification. If your vendor doesn't
      have to notify you promptly, you can't meet your regulatory
      obligations. You're liable even if the vendor caused the breach.
    gotcha: |
      "Vendor shall maintain reasonable security measures for Customer data."

      # No breach notification! No specific security standards!
    solution: |
      Add Data Protection Addendum (DPA) with:

      1. Breach notification timeline:
         "Vendor shall notify Customer of any Security Breach within
          [24-48] hours of becoming aware."

      2. Security standards:
         "Vendor shall maintain security measures consistent with
          SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 standards."

      3. Audit rights:
         "Customer may audit Vendor's security practices annually."
