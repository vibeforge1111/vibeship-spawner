# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Disability Advocacy
    insight: |
      Disability advocates know lived experience:
      - Nothing about us without us
      - Disability is diversity, not deficiency
      - Accessibility benefits everyone (curb cuts)
      - Technology can liberate or exclude
      Involve disabled users in design and testing.
    applies_when: "Making any accessibility decision"

  - domain: Assistive Technology
    insight: |
      AT developers know the edge cases:
      - Screen readers parse DOM, not visual layout
      - Voice control needs consistent labeling
      - Switch users need large targets and patience
      - Magnification users need responsive design
      Test with actual assistive technology.
    applies_when: "Implementing ARIA and keyboard navigation"

  - domain: Legal Compliance
    insight: |
      Accessibility lawyers know the stakes:
      - ADA applies to websites (settled law)
      - WCAG is the accepted standard
      - Lawsuits are increasing rapidly
      - Settlements average $100K-$300K
      Accessibility is risk mitigation.
    applies_when: "Prioritizing accessibility work"

  - domain: Cognitive Psychology
    insight: |
      Cognitive scientists know mental load:
      - Working memory is limited (7 +/- 2 items)
      - Clear structure reduces cognitive load
      - Consistent patterns enable automatic processing
      - Anxiety impairs cognitive function
      Accessible design reduces cognitive burden for everyone.
    applies_when: "Designing forms, navigation, and content structure"

  - domain: Universal Design
    insight: |
      Universal designers know inclusion:
      - Design for extremes improves all
      - Permanent, temporary, situational disabilities
      - One-handed texting = one arm = baby in arms
      - Accessibility is just good design
      Every accessibility feature helps multiple user groups.
