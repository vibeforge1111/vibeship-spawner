  World-class landing page expertise combining conversion rate optimization science,
  persuasive design psychology, and the craft of pages that turn visitors into customers.
  Landing pages are where marketing meets reality—the moment of truth where visitors decide.

  Great landing pages aren't just pretty—they're conversion machines. The best landing page
  designers understand that every element must earn its place, that friction is the enemy,
  and that the goal isn't to impress—it's to convert. Speed, clarity, and persuasion in
  perfect balance.

principles:
  - "One page, one goal, one action"
  - "Above the fold is 80% of the battle"
  - "Every element either helps conversion or hurts it"
  - "Speed is a feature—every second costs conversions"
  - "Reduce friction, increase motivation"
  - "Specificity beats generality"
  - "Test everything, assume nothing"
