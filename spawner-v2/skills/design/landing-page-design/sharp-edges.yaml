# Landing Page Design Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that kill conversions and waste traffic

sharp_edges:
  - id: navigation-trap
    summary: Including full site navigation on landing pages
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Landing page includes full nav: [Home] [About] [Features] [Pricing] [Blog] [Contact]
      Every link is an exit. You paid for that visitor. Navigation steals them.
    why: |
      Landing pages have ONE goal. Every link that isn't that goal is a leak.
      Full navigation can reduce conversions by 30-50%. Visitors click "Blog",
      read an article, leave. Never convert.
    solution: |
      # Remove all navigation
      Landing page ≠ Website page
      One goal = One action

      # What to KEEP:
      ✓ Logo (optionally linked to homepage)
      ✓ Same-page anchor links
      ✓ CTA button

      # What to REMOVE:
      ✗ Full navigation
      ✗ Footer with links
      ✗ Social links
      ✗ "Learn more" to other pages
      ✗ Blog links
    symptoms:
      - High navigation clicks
      - Low time on page before exit
      - Traffic leaking to other pages
      - Low conversion despite traffic
    detection_pattern: '<nav|navigation|class="nav"|class="menu"'

  - id: slow-load-death
    summary: Page takes too long to load
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Page load time: 5+ seconds. Mobile load time: 8+ seconds.
      Beautiful page that nobody ever sees.
    why: |
      1 second delay = 7% conversion loss. 3 second delay = 32% will leave.
      5 second delay = 90% bounce probability. Speed is conversion.
      Google penalizes slow pages. Mobile is often 2x slower.
    solution: |
      # Optimize images:
      - WebP format
      - Lazy loading
      - Right-sized (not scaled in browser)
      - Compressed

      # Minimize resources:
      - Critical CSS only
      - Defer non-essential JS
      - Reduce third-party scripts

      # Core Web Vitals targets:
      - LCP < 2.5s
      - FID < 100ms
      - CLS < 0.1

      # Speed targets:
      Desktop: <2s | Mobile: <3s
    symptoms:
      - High bounce rate
      - Users leaving before page loads
      - Poor Core Web Vitals scores
      - Mobile conversion much lower than desktop

  - id: cta-cemetery
    summary: CTAs buried, hidden, or missing above the fold
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Beautiful hero image, long headline, paragraph of text.
      CTA location: Below the fold. CTA visibility: Low contrast. CTA text: "Submit".
    why: |
      If they can't find it, they can't click it. Most visitors never scroll.
      CTA must be immediately visible. Visual hierarchy should point to CTA.
    solution: |
      # CTA requirements:
      1. Above the fold - Visible without scrolling
      2. High contrast color - Stands out from page
      3. Large enough - 44x44px minimum
      4. Action-oriented text - "Start free trial" not "Submit"
      5. Repeated throughout page

      # Squint test:
      Squint at your page. Can you still find the CTA?
      If not, it needs more prominence.

      # CTA placement:
      - After hero (above fold)
      - After benefits section
      - After social proof
      - Final section
    symptoms:
      - Low click-through rates
      - Users scrolling past CTA
      - "Where do I sign up?"
      - Heatmaps show no CTA engagement

  - id: message-mismatch
    summary: Landing page doesn't match the ad that sent them there
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Ad says: "50% off running shoes"
      Landing page says: "Explore our athletic collection"
      Visitor thinks: "Did I click the wrong link?" → Bounces
    why: |
      Visitors arrive with expectations. You have 3 seconds to confirm them.
      Mismatch = immediate exit. They came for running shoes, you showed them generic catalog.
    solution: |
      # Message match requirements:
      1. Ad headline → Landing page headline (same words)
      2. Same offer, same language
      3. Visual consistency (colors, imagery)
      4. Offer clearly visible

      # Dynamic landing pages:
      - Different versions for different ads
      - Keyword insertion in headlines
      - Personalized content

      # Bad:
      Ad: "Free project management software"
      LP: "The all-in-one productivity suite"

      # Good:
      Ad: "Free project management software"
      LP: "Free Project Management Software - Start today"
    symptoms:
      - High bounce rate from ads
      - Low quality scores in ads
      - '"Scent" broken'
      - Visitors confused on arrival

  - id: form-field-fiasco
    summary: Forms with too many fields
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Lead capture form with 11 fields: name, email, phone, company,
      company size, job title, industry, budget, message, how did you hear...
    why: |
      Each field = friction = drop-off. 4 fields → 3 fields = 50% more conversions.
      Users guard their information. Every field you don't need costs you leads.
    solution: |
      # Minimum viable fields:
      - Lead gen: Email only (or + first name)
      - Trial signup: Email + password
      - Demo request: Name + email + company

      # Progressive profiling:
      - Get email first
      - Ask more later (in-product, email nurture)
      - Build profile over time

      # Field counts:
      Ideal: 1-3 fields
      Acceptable: 4-5 fields
      Too many: 6+ fields

      # For each field ask: "Do we need this NOW?"
      If no, remove it.
    symptoms:
      - Low form completion rate
      - Users abandoning mid-form
      - Fake data submitted
      - High cost per lead

  - id: mobile-afterthought
    summary: Designing for desktop first or only
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Desktop design: Beautiful. Mobile: Hero squashed, text unreadable,
      CTA tiny, form unusable, load time: 12 seconds.
    why: |
      50-70% of traffic is mobile. Mobile has less patience, more friction.
      If 65% of your traffic is mobile and mobile converts at 1% vs desktop 5%,
      you're losing most of your potential customers.
    solution: |
      # Mobile-first design:
      1. Design for mobile first, expand to desktop
      2. Touch-friendly: 44x44px minimum targets
      3. Readable without zoom: 16px minimum
      4. Fast on mobile: <3 seconds
      5. Thumb-zone CTA: Easy reach

      # Mobile checklist:
      □ CTA above fold on mobile
      □ Text readable without zoom
      □ Touch targets 44px+
      □ No horizontal scroll
      □ Form usable on phone
      □ No hover-only actions
    symptoms:
      - Mobile conversion much lower
      - Mobile bounce much higher
      - Pinch-to-zoom required
      - Touch targets missed

  - id: social-proof-desert
    summary: Landing page with no credibility signals
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Page claims: "The best project management tool. Trusted by teams worldwide."
      Proof: None. Logos: None. Testimonials: None. Numbers: None.
    why: |
      Claims without proof are ignored. Trust must be established.
      Other customers' voices > your voice. "Says who? Prove it."
    solution: |
      # Social proof types:
      1. Customer logos (5-7 recognizable brands)
      2. Testimonials (real quotes, real names, photos)
      3. Numbers ("10,000+ teams", "4.9/5 rating")
      4. Trust badges (security, awards, certifications)
      5. Media mentions

      # Strategic placement:
      - Hero: Logo bar
      - Benefits section: Testimonials
      - Near CTA: Reviews/ratings
      - Footer: Full logos

      # Make proof specific:
      Not: "Great tool!"
      But: "Saved us 10 hours/week on reporting" - Jane, Acme Corp
    symptoms:
      - "Why should I trust you?"
      - Low conversion despite traffic
      - High bounce after reading claims
      - No third-party validation

  - id: value-prop-vacuum
    summary: Headline doesn't communicate value proposition
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Hero headline: "Welcome to our platform"
      Or: "Innovation meets simplicity"
      Or: "The future of [vague category]"
    why: |
      You have 5 seconds to communicate value. Headline is your most important copy.
      If they don't understand what you do in 5 seconds, they leave.
      Clarity > cleverness. Every time.
    solution: |
      # Value prop formula:
      [End result customer wants]
      [Specific period/method]
      [Address objection]

      Example: "Close more deals in less time without CRM complexity"

      # Test with strangers:
      Show for 5 seconds. Ask: "What does this company do?"
      If they can't answer, rewrite.

      # Bad headlines:
      "Welcome to Acme"
      "The future of work"
      "Next-generation platform"

      # Good headlines:
      "Project management for teams who ship"
      "Send invoices in 30 seconds"
      "Email marketing that grows with you"
    symptoms:
      - High bounce rate
      - "What does this do?"
      - Visitors confused in 5-second tests
      - Low engagement despite traffic

  - id: distraction-disaster
    summary: Too many competing elements on the page
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Page contains: three different offers, seven CTAs, blog sidebar,
      newsletter popup, chat widget, social feeds, partner links,
      autoplay video, animations everywhere.
    why: |
      Confused minds don't convert. One page, one goal. Every distraction costs conversions.
      Attention is finite. Split it and you lose it.
    solution: |
      # Single goal:
      Define the ONE thing you want them to do.
      Remove everything that isn't that.

      # Distraction audit:
      For every element ask: "Does this help them convert?"
      If no → remove it.

      # Elements to question:
      - Popup immediately on load?
      - Chat widget visible?
      - Sidebar content?
      - Multiple offers?
      - Autoplay video?
      - Excessive animations?

      # Focus test:
      Squint at page. Is there ONE obvious focal point?
      If not, simplify.
    symptoms:
      - Visitors don't know where to look
      - Multiple CTAs compete
      - Heatmaps show scattered attention
      - Low conversion despite engagement

  - id: scroll-assumption
    summary: Assuming visitors will scroll to see important content
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Hero: Beautiful image (no copy). Value prop: Scroll 1. Benefits: Scroll 2.
      Social proof: Scroll 3. CTA: Scroll 4. 85% of visitors see hero only.
    why: |
      Many never scroll. Those who do scroll skim. Above-the-fold real estate is gold.
      If 85% never scroll, 85% of your value is hidden.
    solution: |
      # Complete story above fold:
      - Value prop: Clear
      - What you do: Clear
      - Who it's for: Clear
      - Primary CTA: Visible

      # Above-the-fold must-haves:
      □ Clear headline
      □ Subheadline with benefit
      □ Primary CTA button
      □ Some form of proof

      # Scroll motivation:
      - Partial content visible below fold
      - Visual cue to scroll
      - Promise more value below

      # Sticky elements:
      - Sticky CTA button
      - Follows as they scroll
    symptoms:
      - Key content never seen
      - Low scroll depth
      - High bounce despite good hero
      - CTA at bottom never reached

  - id: generic-stock-photos
    summary: Using inauthentic stock photos that signal generic product
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Handshake photo, smiling people at laptops, multicultural boardroom,
      woman looking at chart, puzzle pieces connecting.
    why: |
      Stock photos are recognized. Generic = forgettable. Trust decreases.
      "This looks like every other site." Authenticity builds trust.
    solution: |
      # Better than stock:
      1. Product screenshots - Real interface
      2. Team photos - Actual people
      3. Customer photos - Real users
      4. Custom illustrations - Unique style

      # Stock clichés to avoid:
      ✗ Business handshake
      ✗ Happy office workers
      ✗ Light bulb / brain
      ✗ Puzzle pieces
      ✗ Rocket ship

      # If stock is necessary:
      - Choose realistic, unstaged
      - Diverse but natural
      - Avoid obvious clichés
    symptoms:
      - Page looks like competitors
      - No memorable visuals
      - Trust signals feel fake
      - Brand personality absent

  - id: objection-silence
    summary: Not addressing common objections before the CTA
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Page covers features, benefits, social proof, CTA. Doesn't address:
      "Is this secure?" "What if I don't like it?" "How hard is setup?"
    why: |
      Every visitor has hesitations. Unaddressed objections = friction.
      Objection in mind → doesn't convert. Overcome before they become blockers.
    solution: |
      # Identify common objections:
      - Talk to sales
      - Read support tickets
      - Survey abandoners

      # Address proactively:
      - Near relevant sections
      - Before the CTA
      - FAQ section

      # Risk reversal:
      - "30-day money-back guarantee"
      - "Free trial, no credit card"
      - "Cancel anytime"

      # Common objections:
      - Price: "Is it worth it?" → ROI calculator, guarantee
      - Risk: "What if it fails?" → Free trial, guarantee
      - Complexity: "Is it hard?" → Setup time, onboarding
      - Trust: "Is my data safe?" → Security badges
    symptoms:
      - Visitors leave at CTA
      - Sales handles same objections
      - High cart abandonment
      - Support gets pre-sale questions
