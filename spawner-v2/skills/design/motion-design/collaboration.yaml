# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Film Animation
    insight: |
      Disney animators codified 12 principles that define great motion:
      - Squash & Stretch: Objects deform during motion
      - Anticipation: Wind-up before action
      - Staging: Clear presentation of ideas
      - Follow Through: Motion continues after stop
      - Slow In/Out: Easing at start and end
      - Arcs: Natural curved motion paths
      - Secondary Action: Supporting movements
      - Timing: Speed defines weight and mood
      - Exaggeration: Push for clarity
      - Appeal: Charismatic design
      UI motion uses these principles, adapted for functional interfaces.
    applies_when: "Designing any interface animation"

  - domain: Choreography
    insight: |
      Choreographers understand ensemble movement:
      - Lead and follow: Primary action leads, secondary follows
      - Timing creates hierarchy: First to move = most important
      - Negative space: Stillness emphasizes motion
      - Unity and variety: Consistent language with variation
      - Rhythm and pacing: Fast/slow contrast creates interest
      UI choreography borrows these stage principles.
    applies_when: "Designing staggered or multi-element animations"

  - domain: Physics
    insight: |
      Real-world physics set user expectations:
      - Inertia: Objects resist starting and stopping
      - Momentum: Moving objects want to keep moving
      - Gravity: Things fall, not rise
      - Friction: Motion naturally dampens
      - Mass: Heavy = slow start, hard stop; Light = quick, bouncy
      UI motion that follows physics feels natural.
    applies_when: "Choosing easing curves and spring physics"

  - domain: Music
    insight: |
      Musicians understand timing deeply:
      - Tempo: Overall speed sets mood
      - Beat: Regular rhythm creates expectation
      - Syncopation: Off-beat creates surprise
      - Crescendo: Building intensity
      - Rest: Silence has meaning
      UI motion timing follows musical principles.
    applies_when: "Orchestrating complex animation sequences"

  - domain: Theater
    insight: |
      Stage directors know about attention:
      - Spotlight: Draw eye to what matters
      - Blocking: Position guides focus
      - Pacing: Control information delivery
      - Reveal: Timing of information
      - Exit: How things leave matters
      UI motion directs attention like stage direction.
    applies_when: "Designing entrance and exit animations"
