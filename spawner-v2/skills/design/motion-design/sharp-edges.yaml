# Motion Design Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that cause jank, motion sickness, or accessibility failures

sharp_edges:
  - id: reduced-motion-ignored
    summary: Not implementing prefers-reduced-motion media query
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Animations play regardless of user preferences. No @media query for
      prefers-reduced-motion anywhere in the codebase. Users with vestibular
      disorders experience motion sickness.
    why: |
      WCAG 2.3.3 requires respecting motion preferences. 35% of adults over 40
      have vestibular disorders. Motion can trigger nausea, vertigo, and migraines.
      This isn't a nice-to-have - it's accessibility compliance.
    solution: |
      # Global reduced motion support (add to base CSS)
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        *, *::before, *::after {
          animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
          animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
          transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
          scroll-behavior: auto !important;
        }
      }

      # Better - semantic reduced motion
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        .parallax { transform: none !important; }
        .animate-bounce { animation: none; }
        .animate-slide { opacity: 1; transform: none; }
      }

      # React hook for JavaScript animations
      const prefersReducedMotion =
        window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;
    symptoms:
      - User complaints about motion sickness
      - Accessibility audit failures
      - Users avoiding your site
      - Vestibular disorder reports

  - id: layout-property-animation
    summary: Animating width, height, top, left instead of transform
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Animations use width, height, margin, top, left, or other layout-triggering
      properties. Animation drops frames, feels janky, especially on mobile or
      slower machines.
    why: |
      Layout-triggering properties force browser to recalculate layout for entire
      page on every frame. Transform and opacity are GPU-accelerated - they don't
      trigger layout. This is the difference between 60fps and 15fps.
    solution: |
      # BAD - triggers layout
      .slide-in {
        transition: left 300ms;
        left: -100%;
      }
      .slide-in.active { left: 0; }

      # GOOD - GPU accelerated
      .slide-in {
        transition: transform 300ms;
        transform: translateX(-100%);
      }
      .slide-in.active { transform: translateX(0); }

      # Property mapping:
      left/right/top/bottom → translateX/translateY
      width/height → scale
      margin → translate

      # Force GPU layer
      .animated { will-change: transform, opacity; }
    symptoms:
      - Choppy animations
      - Frame drops on mobile
      - Battery drain during animation
      - UI feels sluggish
    detection_pattern: 'transition:\s*[^;]*(width|height|left|right|top|bottom|margin|padding).*\d+m?s'

  - id: animation-blocking-interaction
    summary: UI unresponsive during animation completion
    severity: high
    situation: |
      User clicks during animation but nothing happens until animation finishes.
      Modal is closing and user clicks backdrop - click is ignored. Dropdown is
      opening and user clicks away - stuck waiting.
    why: |
      Animation state locks out interaction. Users expect immediate response.
      Forcing users to wait for animation completion feels broken, not polished.
    solution: |
      # Cancel animation on new interaction
      element.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // Cancel any running animation
        element.getAnimations().forEach(anim => anim.cancel());
        // Process click immediately
        handleClick();
      });

      # CSS - allow pointer events during exit
      .modal.closing {
        pointer-events: none;  /* Don't block what's underneath */
      }

      # Framer Motion - interrupt animations
      <motion.div
        animate={{ opacity: isOpen ? 1 : 0 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
        onAnimationComplete={() => {
          if (!isOpen) cleanup();
        }}
      />
    symptoms:
      - Clicks don't register during animation
      - Users clicking multiple times
      - "Is this broken?" feeling
      - Rage clicks on slow animations
    detection_pattern: 'pointer-events:\s*none.*transition'

  - id: linear-easing-movement
    summary: Using linear easing for spatial animations
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Position, scale, or rotation animations use linear timing. Movement feels
      robotic, mechanical, unnatural. Users can't put their finger on why it
      feels wrong.
    why: |
      Real objects accelerate and decelerate. Linear motion doesn't exist in
      nature. The human eye is trained to expect easing. Linear motion triggers
      subconscious "something's off" feeling.
    solution: |
      # BAD
      transition: transform 300ms linear;

      # GOOD - standard easing
      transition: transform 300ms ease-out;      /* entrances */
      transition: transform 300ms ease-in;       /* exits */
      transition: transform 300ms ease-in-out;   /* position changes */

      # Better - precise curves
      --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);
      --ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1);
      --ease-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);

      # Linear is ONLY for:
      # - Continuous spinners
      # - Color transitions
      # - Opacity fades (sometimes)
      # - Progress bars
    symptoms:
      - Animations feel "off"
      - Robotic feeling UI
      - User can't explain discomfort
      - Unpolished appearance
    detection_pattern: 'transition:\s*[^;]*(transform|translate|scale|rotate)[^;]*linear'

  - id: duration-extremes
    summary: Animations too fast (< 100ms) or too slow (> 500ms)
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Micro-interactions are imperceptible (< 100ms) or functional UI feels
      sluggish (> 500ms for modals, dropdowns, etc).
    why: |
      Under 100ms is subliminal - users don't perceive the change, defeating
      the purpose. Over 500ms feels like waiting. Repeated use amplifies
      annoyance exponentially. What feels fine once feels painful 100 times.
    solution: |
      # Timing scale:
      50-100ms:   Instant feedback (button press, toggle)
      150-200ms:  Quick transitions (hover, small movements)
      200-300ms:  Standard transitions (modal, dropdown)
      300-400ms:  Large transitions (page, drawer)
      400-500ms:  Complex reveals (only for emphasis)

      # Never:
      < 100ms for important state changes (invisible)
      > 500ms for anything functional (frustrating)
      > 300ms for hover states (feels unresponsive)

      # Test: Use the feature 50 times in a row
      # If animation becomes irritating, it's too slow
    symptoms:
      - Users don't notice animation (too fast)
      - Users waiting for UI (too slow)
      - Frustration on repeated use
      - "Laggy" user feedback

  - id: z-index-animation-clash
    summary: Z-index conflicts during animation causing visual glitches
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Animated elements disappear behind other content. Modal animates but
      content shows through. Dropdown clips behind adjacent elements.
      Stacking contexts create unexpected layering.
    why: |
      Transforms create new stacking contexts. Z-index works within stacking
      context, not globally. Animated elements may not be in expected layer.
    solution: |
      # Understand stacking contexts
      # These create new stacking context:
      - position: fixed/sticky
      - transform: anything
      - opacity < 1
      - filter: anything
      - will-change
      - isolation: isolate

      # Solution: Explicit stacking
      :root {
        --z-dropdown: 100;
        --z-sticky: 200;
        --z-modal-backdrop: 400;
        --z-modal: 500;
        --z-popover: 600;
        --z-tooltip: 700;
      }

      # Isolation for animated containers
      .animated-container {
        isolation: isolate;
        z-index: var(--z-modal);
      }
    symptoms:
      - Elements disappear during animation
      - Unexpected overlap
      - "Z-index doesn't work"
      - Modal content shows through backdrop

  - id: parallax-performance-death
    summary: Heavy parallax effects causing scroll jank
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Scroll-based parallax animations cause stuttering, dropped frames, and
      high CPU usage. Mobile devices struggle. Users report laggy scrolling.
    why: |
      Parallax often uses scroll events + transforms on multiple elements.
      JavaScript scroll handlers fire hundreds of times per second. Each
      recalculation triggers layout or paint. Mobile GPUs can't keep up.
    solution: |
      # Bad - scroll event listener
      window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
        element.style.transform = `translateY(${scrollY * 0.5}px)`;
      });

      # Better - CSS only parallax
      .parallax-container {
        perspective: 1px;
        overflow-x: hidden;
        overflow-y: auto;
      }
      .parallax-layer {
        transform: translateZ(-1px) scale(2);
      }

      # Best - Intersection Observer for simple reveals
      # Avoid parallax entirely for most use cases

      # CRITICAL: Disable for reduced motion
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        .parallax-layer { transform: none; }
      }
    symptoms:
      - Stuttering scroll
      - High CPU during scroll
      - Mobile performance issues
      - Battery drain

  - id: animation-memory-leak
    summary: Animations continue running when component unmounts
    severity: high
    situation: |
      React/Vue component unmounts but animation continues. requestAnimationFrame
      keeps firing. GSAP timelines keep running. Lottie animations play to
      destroyed DOM. Memory usage climbs over time.
    why: |
      JavaScript animations don't automatically stop when DOM elements are
      removed. Animation frames keep firing, callbacks keep executing.
      Memory leaks accumulate, eventually crashing tab.
    solution: |
      # React - cleanup animations
      useEffect(() => {
        const animation = element.animate(...);
        return () => animation.cancel();  // Cleanup!
      }, []);

      # GSAP cleanup
      useEffect(() => {
        const tl = gsap.timeline();
        tl.to(elementRef.current, { x: 100 });
        return () => tl.kill();  // Kill timeline on unmount
      }, []);

      # Framer Motion - automatic cleanup via AnimatePresence
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isVisible && <motion.div exit={{ opacity: 0 }} />}
      </AnimatePresence>

      # requestAnimationFrame cleanup
      useEffect(() => {
        let rafId;
        const animate = () => {
          // animation logic
          rafId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        };
        rafId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        return () => cancelAnimationFrame(rafId);
      }, []);
    symptoms:
      - Memory usage growing
      - Console warnings about unmounted updates
      - Tab becoming slow over time
      - "Can't perform state update on unmounted component"
    detection_pattern: 'requestAnimationFrame(?![\\s\\S]*cancelAnimationFrame)'

  - id: spring-animation-overshoot
    summary: Spring animations that overshoot and overlap content
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Spring/bounce animations overshoot bounds, overlapping adjacent content
      or extending beyond viewport. Modal bounces past its final position.
      Elements briefly cover other interactive areas.
    why: |
      Spring physics includes overshoot by design. Without constraints, elements
      can temporarily occupy unintended space, causing visual glitches and
      accessibility issues (covered content becomes inaccessible).
    solution: |
      # Framer Motion - clamp spring
      <motion.div
        animate={{ y: 0 }}
        transition={{
          type: "spring",
          stiffness: 300,
          damping: 30,
          restDelta: 0.001
        }}
      />

      # High damping = less overshoot
      # damping ratio 1.0 = critical damping (no overshoot)

      # CSS containment
      .modal-container {
        overflow: hidden;  /* Contain overshoot */
      }

      # React Spring - clamp option
      useSpring({
        y: 0,
        config: { clamp: true }  /* No overshoot */
      })
    symptoms:
      - Elements briefly overlap others
      - Flash of content outside bounds
      - Scrollbars appearing briefly
      - Visual jank at animation end

  - id: no-will-change-cleanup
    summary: will-change applied permanently instead of dynamically
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      will-change: transform applied in base CSS, never removed. Browser keeps
      GPU layers allocated permanently. Memory usage high. Compositing costs
      increase across entire page.
    why: |
      will-change tells browser to prepare for animation. It allocates GPU
      memory and creates compositor layers. Keeping it always-on wastes
      resources and can actually hurt performance.
    solution: |
      # BAD - permanent will-change
      .card {
        will-change: transform;  /* Always on = memory waste */
      }

      # GOOD - dynamic will-change
      .card:hover {
        will-change: transform;  /* Only when needed */
      }
      .card:not(:hover) {
        will-change: auto;  /* Release resources */
      }

      # Best - JavaScript controlled
      element.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
        element.style.willChange = 'transform';
      });
      element.addEventListener('animationend', () => {
        element.style.willChange = 'auto';
      });

      # Only use will-change for:
      # - Complex animations that are about to happen
      # - Elements that animate frequently
      # Remove after animation completes
    symptoms:
      - High GPU memory usage
      - Slow performance with many elements
      - DevTools shows many compositor layers
      - Mobile battery drain

  - id: transform-origin-forgotten
    summary: Scale/rotate animations with wrong transform-origin
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Element scales from wrong point (center instead of corner). Rotation
      pivots unexpectedly. Animation looks wrong but hard to diagnose.
    why: |
      Default transform-origin is center. Scaling from center ≠ scaling from
      button position. Rotation from center ≠ hinge rotation. Origin must
      match the visual metaphor.
    solution: |
      # Default behavior
      transform-origin: center center;  /* Default */

      # Scale from top-left (dropdown from button)
      .dropdown {
        transform-origin: top left;
        transform: scale(0);
      }
      .dropdown.open { transform: scale(1); }

      # Common origins:
      - Dropdown: top left or top center
      - Context menu: top left
      - Modal: center center
      - Toast: bottom right (if appearing there)
      - Tooltip: varies by position

      # Match origin to trigger element position
      const rect = trigger.getBoundingClientRect();
      dropdown.style.transformOrigin =
        `${rect.left}px ${rect.top}px`;
    symptoms:
      - Animation looks "off"
      - Element appears from wrong direction
      - Scaling feels disconnected
      - Rotation pivot unexpected

  - id: infinite-animation-battery-drain
    summary: Infinite animations running on non-visible elements
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Loading spinner keeps animating in hidden tab. Pulsing elements animate
      while scrolled out of view. Continuous animations run in minimized windows.
    why: |
      Animations consume CPU/GPU even when not visible. Battery drain on mobile.
      Performance impact on other tabs/apps. Waste of resources.
    solution: |
      # Intersection Observer - pause when not visible
      const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
        entries.forEach(entry => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting) {

    symptoms:
      - Battery drain when page is "idle"
      - CPU usage in background tab
      - Slow overall browser performance
