# ==============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ==============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Arcade Cabinet Design
    insight: |
      Arcade UI designers knew attention spans:
      - Instructions must be read in 10 seconds
      - Critical info at eye level (top of screen)
      - High contrast for varying cabinet lighting
      - Font sizes readable from standing distance
      - Insert Coin prompt is always visible and obvious
      Game UI still benefits from these lessons.
    applies_when: "Designing attract screens, quick-play games, or arcade-style titles"

  - domain: Console History
    insight: |
      Console generations taught UI lessons:
      - NES: Simple, bold, readable on CRTs
      - SNES: More detail, still prioritized clarity
      - PS1/N64: 3D UI experiments (mostly failures)
      - Modern: Return to 2D clarity with depth
      - Handheld: Optimization for small screens
      Every failed UI experiment in gaming history is a lesson.
    applies_when: "Designing for specific console generations or retro aesthetics"

  - domain: Esports and Competitive Gaming
    insight: |
      Competitive games demand:
      - Information clarity over style
      - Millisecond-accurate cooldown displays
      - Team differentiation (color + shape + position)
      - Spectator-readable at tournament scale
      - Consistent element positioning across patches
      If esports players need custom HUDs, the default failed.
    applies_when: "Designing for competitive multiplayer games"

  - domain: Television Broadcast Design
    insight: |
      TV graphics designers know:
      - Safe zones exist because overscan is real
      - Lower thirds avoid the action
      - Tickers/scrollers for secondary info
      - 3-second read rule for on-screen text
      - Color temperature varies by display
      Sports broadcasts are real-time information design.
    applies_when: "Designing HUDs with lots of information (sports games, sims)"

  - domain: Aviation Instrumentation
    insight: |
      Cockpit designers understand:
      - Critical info in center (attitude indicator)
      - Redundant indicators for vital systems
      - Failure modes (what shows when sensors fail)
      - Scanning patterns (trained eye movement)
      - Alerts with priority hierarchy
      Flight sim UI inherits these requirements directly.
    applies_when: "Designing simulation games or complex vehicle interfaces"

  - domain: Accessibility Standards
    insight: |
      WCAG and game accessibility guidelines overlap:
      - Color is never the only indicator
      - Text alternatives for audio cues
      - Adjustable text sizes
      - Reduced motion options
      - One-handed play considerations
      Accessible games are better games for everyone.
    applies_when: "Any game UI design - accessibility is always relevant"
