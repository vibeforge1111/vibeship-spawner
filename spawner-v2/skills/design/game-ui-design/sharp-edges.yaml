# Game UI Design Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that make game interfaces confusing, inaccessible, or broken across platforms

sharp_edges:
  - id: safe-zone-violation
    summary: Critical UI elements placed outside TV safe zones
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Health bar in corner gets cut off on TVs. Ammo counter invisible on some displays.
      Quest text runs off screen edge. Players complain "I can't see my health."
    why: |
      TVs have overscan - they cut off 3-10% of edges. This varies by manufacturer, model,
      and settings. Unlike monitors, TVs assume video content with safe margins. Console
      certification often requires safe zone compliance. Players will refund games they
      can't play properly on their setup.
    solution: |
      # Safe zone implementation

      Action safe (93% of screen):
      - Gameplay can extend to edges
      - Moving elements can reach here

      Title safe (90% of screen):
      - All static HUD elements
      - All text must be within this
      - All interactive elements

      Implementation:
      // Calculate safe margins
      float safeMargin = screenWidth * 0.05f; // 5% each side = 90% safe
      Rect safeArea = new Rect(
          safeMargin, safeMargin,
          screenWidth - safeMargin * 2,
          screenHeight - safeMargin * 2
      );

      // Position HUD elements within safeArea
      healthBar.position = safeArea.topLeft + offset;

      Required: Safe zone slider in options (0-10%)
      Default to conservative 5% for console, 0% for PC
    symptoms:
      - "I can't see my health bar"
      - "Text is cut off on my TV"
      - Console certification failure
      - Player complaints vary by display

  - id: controller-navigation-deadend
    summary: Menu elements unreachable or trapped via controller navigation
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Can't select certain buttons with D-pad. Tab key navigates but controller can't
      switch tabs. Inventory grid has no exit point. Confirmation popup not focusable.
    why: |
      Controller players literally cannot complete actions. Game becomes unplayable.
      This is the #1 cause of "unplayable with controller" reviews. Mouse was added
      as fallback but controller-only players (console, Steam Deck) are stuck.
    solution: |
      # Controller navigation audit checklist

      1. Focus system:
         - Every interactive element can receive focus
         - Visual focus indicator is obvious (not subtle)
         - Focus indicator works on all backgrounds

      2. Navigation:
         - D-pad moves focus logically (not randomly)
         - Wrapping: End of row -> Start of next row
         - Escape routes: Every menu has clear "back" path
         - Tab equivalent: LB/RB switch major sections

      3. Test flow:
         Start game with controller only:
         ✓ Main menu -> Options -> All submenus -> Back
         ✓ Game -> Pause -> All menu items -> Resume
         ✓ Inventory -> All slots -> Equip -> Exit
         ✓ Shop -> Browse -> Buy -> Exit
         ✓ Dialogue -> All choices -> Advance

      4. Focus traps to fix:
         - Modal dialogs must trap then release focus
         - Dropdowns must be navigable and closable
         - Nested menus need clear back behavior

      // Unity example - ensure navigation
      button.navigation = new Navigation {
          mode = Navigation.Mode.Explicit,
          selectOnUp = upButton,
          selectOnDown = downButton,
          selectOnLeft = leftButton,
          selectOnRight = rightButton
      };
    symptoms:
      - "Can't select this with controller"
      - Focus indicator disappears
      - Stuck in submenu
      - Must use mouse to continue

  - id: resolution-scaling-failure
    summary: UI designed for one resolution, broken at others
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      UI perfect at 1080p. At 4K, elements are tiny. At 720p, elements overlap.
      On ultrawide, HUD is stretched or off-center. On Steam Deck, unreadable.
    why: |
      Modern games run on displays from 720p handhelds to 8K TVs. Viewing distance
      varies from 1 foot (monitor) to 10 feet (TV). Fixed pixel sizes become
      microscopic or massive. Players shouldn't need perfect vision to play.
    solution: |
      # Resolution-independent UI design

      1. Reference resolution:
         - Design at 1080p (1920x1080)
         - This is your "100% scale" baseline

      2. Scaling modes:
         - Scale With Screen Size (Unity Canvas Scaler)
         - Match Width Or Height based on game type
         - Wide games: Match height (1080p reference)
         - Tall games: Match width

      3. UI Scale option:
         Settings -> UI Scale: [50%] [75%] [100%] [125%] [150%] [200%]
         Apply immediately, save preference
         Default higher for TV/console

      4. Testing checklist:
         □ 1280x720 (Steam Deck, Switch)
         □ 1920x1080 (baseline)
         □ 2560x1440 (gaming monitors)
         □ 3840x2160 (4K TVs)
         □ 2560x1080 (ultrawide)
         □ 3440x1440 (ultrawide)

      5. Minimum readable sizes at 1080p:
         - Body text: 16px (scale up from here)
         - Important info: 24px+
         - Icons: 32x32px minimum

      // Unity Canvas Scaler setup
      canvasScaler.uiScaleMode = CanvasScaler.ScaleMode.ScaleWithScreenSize;
      canvasScaler.referenceResolution = new Vector2(1920, 1080);
      canvasScaler.matchWidthOrHeight = 1f; // Match height
    symptoms:
      - UI tiny on 4K
      - Elements overlap at low resolution
      - Text unreadable on Steam Deck
      - Ultrawide has centered HUD with empty sides

  - id: input-prompt-mismatch
    summary: Showing wrong controller button icons for current input device
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Playing with PlayStation controller, shows Xbox buttons. Switch between
      keyboard and controller, prompts don't update. "[Press A]" but I have
      no A button.
    why: |
      Players don't know what button to press. Breaks tutorials completely.
      Creates confusion and support tickets. PlayStation players see Xbox prompts
      as disrespectful. Professional games handle this seamlessly.
    solution: |
      # Input prompt system

      1. Detect input type:
         - Track last input device used
         - Switch prompts on ANY input from different device
         - Small delay (200ms) prevents flashing

      2. Icon sets needed:
         - Xbox (default for "generic gamepad")
         - PlayStation (detect DualShock/DualSense)
         - Nintendo Switch (button positions differ!)
         - Keyboard + Mouse
         - Touch (mobile)

      3. Button mapping awareness:
         // Don't hardcode "[Press A]"
         string prompt = GetPromptForAction("confirm");
         // Returns "[A]" or "[X]" or "[Space]" etc.

         // Handle rebinding
         if (playerReboundConfirm) {
             prompt = GetBoundKeyPrompt("confirm");
         }

      4. Platform detection:
         // Unity example
         if (Gamepad.current is DualShockGamepad) {
             UsePlayStationIcons();
         } else if (Gamepad.current != null) {
             UseXboxIcons(); // Default for generic
         } else {
             UseKeyboardIcons();
         }

      5. Steam Input consideration:
         - Steam can remap any controller
         - Use Steam Input API glyphs when available
         - Falls back to detected type otherwise
    symptoms:
      - "Says press A but I'm on PlayStation"
      - Prompts show keyboard when using controller
      - Tutorial impossible to follow
      - Prompts don't update when switching input
    detection_pattern: '"Press A"|"Press X"|"Press \[A\]"'

  - id: colorblind-failure
    summary: Critical information conveyed only through color
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Enemy health bars red, friendly bars green - colorblind players can't distinguish.
      Rarity indicated only by color glow. Damage types by color with no icon.
      "Red means stop" but 8% of players can't see red properly.
    why: |
      8% of men and 0.5% of women have color vision deficiency. Red-green blindness
      (deuteranopia/protanopia) is most common - exactly the colors games use for
      enemy/ally. Without accommodation, games are literally unplayable for millions.
    solution: |
      # Colorblind-accessible design

      1. Never color alone:
         - Enemy: Red + hostile icon + "Enemy" label
         - Ally: Blue + friendly icon + "Ally" label
         - Health: Red bar + "HP" text + current/max numbers

      2. Shape differentiation:
         Common   | Danger  | Safe    | Neutral
         Circle   | Triangle| Diamond | Square
         ●        | ▲       | ◆       | ■

      3. Rarity without color:
         Common:    Plain border
         Uncommon:  Single line border
         Rare:      Double border
         Epic:      Border + corner ornament
         Legendary: Full ornate frame

      4. Built-in colorblind modes:
         Settings -> Accessibility -> Colorblind Mode:
         - Off
         - Deuteranopia (red-green, most common)
         - Protanopia (red-green, different)
         - Tritanopia (blue-yellow, rare)

         Adjust affected colors:
         - Enemy red -> Orange/Pink
         - Ally green -> Blue/Cyan
         - Increase contrast

      5. Testing tools:
         - Coblis color blindness simulator
         - Photoshop: View -> Proof Setup -> Color Blindness
         - Windows: Ease of Access -> Color Filters
    symptoms:
      - "Can't tell enemies from allies"
      - "What rarity is this item?"
      - Player complaints from colorblind users
      - Accessibility certification failure

  - id: font-size-disaster
    summary: Text too small to read on target displays
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Designed on 27" monitor, unreadable on TV from couch. Tooltips require
      squinting. Damage numbers illegible during combat. Item descriptions
      need a magnifying glass.
    why: |
      Viewing distance varies drastically. 1080p on 24" monitor at 2 feet is very
      different from 1080p on 50" TV at 10 feet. Small text strains eyes, excludes
      players with vision impairment, and creates accessibility failures.
    solution: |
      # Font size guidelines

      1. Minimum sizes at 1080p (scale proportionally):
         - Critical HUD (health, ammo): 24px+
         - Standard UI text: 18px
         - Secondary info: 16px
         - Minimum for anything: 14px

      2. TV/Console multiplier:
         Base PC size * 1.25 to 1.5 for TV viewing
         Or detect TV mode and adjust automatically

      3. Font size option:
         Settings -> Accessibility -> Text Size:
         [Small] [Normal] [Large] [Larger]
         Affects ALL text proportionally

      4. Font choice matters:
         - Sans-serif for UI (clean, readable)
         - Avoid thin weights (Light, Thin)
         - Test lowercase readability (a, e, c)
         - High x-height fonts read better small

      5. Contrast for readability:
         - Dark text on light: #333 on #FFF
         - Light text on dark: #FFF on #222
         - Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
         - Higher contrast for smaller text

      6. Dynamic sizing test:
         □ Read all text from 10 feet away
         □ Readable while character is moving
         □ Legible during intense action
         □ Check tooltip/description text
    symptoms:
      - "Text too small"
      - Players lean forward to read
      - Squinting during gameplay
      - Requests for text size option
    detection_pattern: 'fontSize:\s*1[0-4](px)?|font-size:\s*1[0-4]px'

  - id: motion-sickness-trigger
    summary: UI animations that cause discomfort or vestibular issues
    severity: high
    situation: |
      UI slides in from off-screen constantly. Screen shake applied to UI elements.
      Parallax scrolling in menus. Aggressive camera animations on menu transitions.
    why: |
      Vestibular disorders affect millions. Excessive motion causes nausea, headaches,
      and disorientation. Some players physically cannot play games with excessive
      motion. This is an accessibility requirement, not a preference.
    solution: |
      # Motion-safe UI design

      1. Respect system preferences:
         // Check OS-level reduced motion setting
         if (SystemPreferences.ReducedMotion) {
             DisableUIAnimations();
             UseInstantTransitions();
         }

      2. In-game option:
         Settings -> Accessibility -> Reduce Motion: [On/Off]
         Affects:
         - Screen shake intensity (separate slider)
         - UI transition animations
         - Camera motion in menus
         - Parallax effects

      3. Safe vs problematic animations:
         SAFE:
         - Fade in/out (opacity only)
         - Scale from 95% to 100% (subtle)
         - Color transitions
         - Progress bar fills

         PROBLEMATIC:
         - Slide from off-screen
         - Bounce/elastic effects
         - Screen shake
         - Rotation
         - Parallax scrolling
         - Zoom animations

      4. When motion is needed:
         - Duration under 200ms
         - Ease-out only (starts fast, slows)
         - Small travel distance
         - Single direction (no zig-zag)

      5. Screen shake specifically:
         Settings -> Camera Shake: [Off] [Low] [Medium] [High]
         NEVER apply shake to UI, only world
    symptoms:
      - Reports of nausea
      - "Too much animation"
      - Requests for reduced motion
      - Players quitting after short sessions
    detection_pattern: 'animation-duration:\s*[5-9][0-9]{2}ms|animation-duration:\s*[1-9]s'

  - id: touch-target-too-small
    summary: Interactive elements too small for reliable touch or controller selection
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Mobile port has tiny buttons. Close button is 16x16 pixels. Inventory
      slots require surgical precision. Controller selection boxes smaller
      than visual elements.
    why: |
      Fingers are imprecise. Thumbs on touchscreen are worse. Controller stick
      navigation needs generous selection areas. Small targets cause misclicks,
      frustration, and make games feel broken. Apple and Google have guidelines
      for a reason.
    solution: |
      # Touch and selection target sizes

      1. Minimum sizes:
         - Apple: 44x44pt minimum
         - Google: 48x48dp minimum
         - Game UI: 48x48 pixels at 1080p (scale up)
         - Generous: 56x56+ for important actions

      2. Visual vs touchable area:
         Icon can be 24x24, but touch area must be 48x48
         ┌────────────────┐
         │   ┌────────┐   │
         │   │ [icon] │   │ <- Visual 24x24
         │   └────────┘   │
         └────────────────┘  <- Touch 48x48

      3. Spacing between targets:
         Minimum 8px gap between touchable areas
         Prevents accidental adjacent selection

      4. Controller selection:
         - Selection highlight larger than element
         - D-pad navigation snaps to logical grid
         - Visible focus indicator, not just color

      5. Implementation:
         // Unity Button with invisible expanded hitbox
         [RequireComponent(typeof(Image))]
         public class TouchExpander : MonoBehaviour {
             public void OnValidate() {
                 GetComponent<Image>().alphaHitTestMinimumThreshold = 0f;
                 // Expand RectTransform beyond visible content
             }
         }

      6. Test protocol:
         - Test with thumb, not stylus/mouse
         - Test in motion (simulated gameplay)
         - Test one-handed (portrait mobile)
         - Test with controller only
    symptoms:
      - Misclicks and wrong selections
      - "Buttons too small"
      - Controller navigation feels imprecise
      - Mobile players struggle

  - id: hud-obscures-gameplay
    summary: UI elements blocking critical gameplay visibility
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Health bar placed over where enemies spawn. Minimap covers corner where
      snipers hide. Dialogue box obscures player character. Quest tracker
      blocks loot on ground.
    why: |
      Players die to things they can't see. Information meant to help them
      actually hurts them. Screen real estate is precious - every UI element
      costs visibility. This breaks the fundamental contract of fair play.
    solution: |
      # HUD positioning principles

      1. Critical gameplay areas:
         - Center: Crosshair area must be clear
         - Player character: Must be visible
         - Immediate threat zone: Usually center/forward
         - Interaction zone: Where player looks

      2. Safe HUD positions:
         ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
         │ [Health]          [Minimap] │ <- Corners
         │                             │
         │                             │
         │                             │ <- Center is sacred
         │                             │
         │ [Abilities]    [Objectives] │ <- Bottom corners
         └───────────────────────────────────┘

      3. Dynamic hiding:
         - Combat mode: Hide non-essential UI
         - Cinematic mode: Hide all UI
         - Photo mode: Complete UI removal
         - Aim down sights: Clear crosshair area

      4. Transparency for non-critical:
         - Minimap: 60-80% opacity
         - Quest tracker: 70% opacity
         - Background of tooltips: Semi-transparent

      5. Player control:
         Settings -> HUD Position: [Preset/Custom]
         Allow repositioning of individual elements
         Save per-element opacity preferences

      6. Special case - dialogue:
         - Position at bottom with speaker portrait
         - Never over player character
         - Semi-transparent or opaque options
         - Auto-advance option for accessibility
    symptoms:
      - "Enemy came from behind the minimap"
      - "Can't see my character"
      - Players turn off helpful UI

  - id: no-text-outline-or-shadow
    summary: Text without outline/shadow becomes unreadable on varied backgrounds
    severity: high
    situation: |
      White text on bright sky - invisible. Dark text on shadows - invisible.
      Health numbers unreadable over fire effects. Damage numbers lost in
      spell particles.
    why: |
      Games have dynamic backgrounds. What's readable on one frame is invisible
      on the next. UI text must be legible regardless of what's behind it.
      This is the most common HUD readability problem and easiest to fix.
    solution: |
      # Text readability techniques

      1. Text outline (best):
         2px stroke in contrasting color
         White text -> Black outline
         Black text -> White outline
         Colored text -> Dark outline

      2. Drop shadow (good):
         2-4px offset, 50% opacity
         Direction: Down-right (light from top-left)
         Blur: 0-2px (sharp better than blurry)

      3. Background panel (safest):
         Semi-transparent dark background
         20-40% black behind text
         Consistent container approach

      4. Combined approach (recommended):
         Text + 1px outline + subtle shadow + panel
         Readable in any situation

      5. Never:
         - Thin fonts without outline
         - Low contrast (gray on gray)
         - Relying on background being consistent

      // CSS example
      .hud-text {
          color: white;
          text-shadow:
              -2px -2px 0 black,
               2px -2px 0 black,
              -2px  2px 0 black,
               2px  2px 0 black,
              0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
      }

      // Unity TextMeshPro
      Set Outline Width: 0.2
      Set Outline Color: Black
      Enable Underlay for shadow effect
    symptoms:
      - "Can't read the numbers"
      - Text disappears on certain backgrounds

  - id: inconsistent-button-behavior
    summary: Same button does different things across different screens
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "B" backs out of inventory but closes the game in pause menu. "Y" confirms
      here but cancels there. Accept/Cancel positions swap between menus.
    why: |
      Players build muscle memory. Inconsistency causes them to accidentally
      close games, delete saves, or make wrong purchases. Every surprise
      breaks trust. This is death by a thousand cuts.
    solution: |
      # Consistent button mapping

      1. Universal mappings (never change):
         A/Cross: Confirm, Select, Progress
         B/Circle: Back, Cancel, Close
         Start: Pause, Menu
         Select: Map, Secondary menu

      2. Contextual mappings (show prompts):
         Y/Triangle: Context action 1 (inspect, pickup)
         X/Square: Context action 2 (drop, use)
         Bumpers: Navigate tabs, cycle
         Triggers: Page up/down, zoom

      3. Position consistency:
         - "Back" always same position in menu
         - "Confirm" always same position
         - Sort order consistent (Accept-Cancel, not Cancel-Accept)

      4. Dangerous actions:
         - Require hold, not tap
         - Different button than adjacent actions
         - Confirmation dialog
         - "Are you sure?" for delete/quit

      5. Document and display:
         - Button legend on screen
         - Prompts update with context
         - Settings shows full mapping

      6. Platform conventions:
         Xbox: A=Yes, B=No
         PlayStation (Japan): Circle=Yes, Cross=No
         PlayStation (West): Cross=Yes, Circle=No
         Support both conventions in settings
    symptoms:
      - "I accidentally quit the game"
      - "B should go back, not close"
      - Players confused by changing behavior
      - Wrong action taken frequently
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: no-keyboard-shortcut-display
    summary: Keyboard controls exist but aren't shown, or rebinding breaks prompts
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      "There are keyboard shortcuts?" "I rebound WASD but prompts still show WASD."
      Alt+F4 closes game with no warning. Hidden shortcuts in tooltip footnotes only.
    why: |
      Players don't discover helpful shortcuts. Rebinding makes prompts lies.
      Power users frustrated by hidden functionality. New players miss efficiency.
    solution: |
      # Keyboard shortcut visibility

      1. Show bound keys, not defaults:
         // Wrong
         prompt = "Press SPACE to jump";

         // Right
         string jumpKey = GetBoundKey("Jump");
         prompt = $"Press {jumpKey} to jump";

      2. Tooltip shortcuts:
         Inventory (I)
         Map (M)
         Quest Log (J)
         Show bound key, not hardcoded

      3. Key legend option:
         Settings -> Controls -> Show Keybinds: On/Off
         Toggle key legend overlay

      4. Rebinding awareness:
         - On rebind, update all prompts
         - Show conflicts when rebinding
         - "Reset to defaults" option

      5. Alt+F4 handling:
         - Either disable or show save confirmation
         - Don't lose unsaved progress
         - Or explicitly support it as "quick quit"

      6. Hidden shortcuts documentation:
         Controls screen lists ALL shortcuts
         Include "advanced" section
         Searchable if extensive
    symptoms:
      - "Didn't know there was a shortcut"
      - Prompts show wrong key after rebind
      - Player loses progress to Alt+F4
      - "What does this key do?"
    detection_pattern: '"Press [A-Z]"|"Press Space"|"Press Enter"'
