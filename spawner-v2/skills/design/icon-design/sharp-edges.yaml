  - id: pixel-grid-misalignment
    summary: Icon strokes not aligned to pixel grid causing blurry rendering
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Icons look crisp in Figma but appear blurry in browser or app.
      Horizontal and vertical lines have a fuzzy appearance.
      Strokes seem thicker or thinner than designed.
    why: |
      Screen rendering anti-aliases sub-pixel elements. A 1px stroke positioned at
      x=10 spans from 9.5 to 10.5, causing both pixels to render at 50% opacity.
      This makes sharp lines look blurry. The effect worsens on non-retina displays.
    solution: |
      # Pixel alignment rules:

      For 1px strokes:
      - Position center on half-pixel (10.5, not 10)
      - Stroke spans 10 to 11 (full pixels)

      For 2px strokes:
      - Position center on whole pixel (10, not 10.5)
      - Stroke spans 9 to 11 (full pixels)

      # Figma workflow:
      1. View > Pixel Preview (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
      2. Zoom to 100%
      3. Check horizontal/vertical edges
      4. Nudge by 0.5px if blurry

      # SVG check:
      - Path coordinates should be .5 for 1px strokes
      - Path coordinates should be whole numbers for 2px strokes
    symptoms:
      - Icons look fuzzy at 100% zoom
      - Strokes appear inconsistent thickness
      - Fine details merge together
      - Icons look worse on non-retina screens

  - id: svg-viewbox-mismatch
    summary: SVG viewBox doesn't match intended design dimensions
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Icons render at wrong size or aspect ratio. Cropping or extra whitespace appears.
      Icons stretch or squish when resized.
    why: |
      viewBox defines the coordinate system. If icon was designed at 24x24 but
      viewBox is "0 0 16 16", the icon is scaled and distorted. Missing viewBox
      means browser guesses dimensions based on width/height attributes.
    solution: |
      # viewBox must match design artboard:

      # WRONG - 24px design with 16px viewBox
      <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16">
        <path d="M12 3L22 12L12 21" /> <!-- coords exceed viewBox -->
      </svg>

      # RIGHT - viewBox matches design
      <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M9 6L15 12L9 18" />
      </svg>

      # Standard viewBox values:
      - 16px icons: viewBox="0 0 16 16"
      - 20px icons: viewBox="0 0 20 20"
      - 24px icons: viewBox="0 0 24 24"
      - 32px icons: viewBox="0 0 32 32"

      # Export check: Verify artboard size = viewBox dimensions
    symptoms:
      - Icons cropped or have excess padding
      - Icons stretched or squished
      - Inconsistent sizing across icon set
      - Icons overflow container

  - id: hardcoded-colors-svg
    summary: Colors hardcoded in SVG preventing theme/dark mode support
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Icons work in light mode but disappear or look wrong in dark mode.
      Can't change icon color via CSS. Different icons have different default colors.
    why: |
      Hardcoded fill="#000000" or stroke="#333" overrides CSS.
      Icons can't inherit color from parent. Each icon needs separate assets for each color scheme.
      Maintenance nightmare when brand colors change.
    solution: |
      # Use currentColor for theme support:

      # BAD - hardcoded color
      <svg fill="#000000">
        <path d="..." stroke="#333333"/>
      </svg>

      # GOOD - inherits from CSS color property
      <svg fill="currentColor">
        <path d="..."/>
      </svg>

      # GOOD - stroke icons
      <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5">
        <path d="..."/>
      </svg>

      # CSS controls color:
      .icon { color: #333; }
      .dark .icon { color: #fff; }

      # For multi-color icons, use CSS custom properties:
      <svg>
        <path fill="var(--icon-primary)"/>
        <path fill="var(--icon-secondary)"/>
      </svg>
    symptoms:
      - Icons invisible in dark mode
      - Can't style icon color with CSS
      - Inconsistent icon colors across app
      - Need separate icon files per color
    detection_pattern: 'fill="#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}"|stroke="#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}"'

  - id: non-square-artboard
    summary: Icon designed on non-square artboard causing aspect ratio issues
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Icons appear stretched or compressed. Icon doesn't fit properly in icon containers.
      Alignment issues when icons are placed in rows.
    why: |
      Icons should be square for consistent sizing and alignment.
      Non-square icons (24x20, 18x24) don't fit standard icon containers.
      CSS sizing assumes square: width: 24px; height: 24px breaks non-square icons.
    solution: |
      # Always use square artboards:

      # Standard icon sizes (all square):
      - 16x16px
      - 20x20px
      - 24x24px (most common)
      - 32x32px
      - 48x48px

      # For wide/tall icons:
      - Use same square artboard
      - Icon touches edges on longer dimension
      - Center on shorter dimension
      - Maintains consistent bounding box

      # Example: Wide "menu" icon on 24x24:
      - Menu bars: 20px wide (fills horizontal)
      - Centered vertically with 6px above/below
      - Still exports as 24x24

      # viewBox always square:
      viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    symptoms:
      - Icons stretched when sized uniformly
      - Uneven spacing between icons
      - Icons break layout grids
      - Aspect ratio varies across icon set
    detection_pattern: 'viewBox="0 0 \d+ (?!\d+ ")'

  - id: stroke-weight-scaling-failure
    summary: Single stroke weight used across all sizes causing visibility issues
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Icons look fine at 24px but strokes disappear or blur at 16px.
      Icons look too heavy at 32px. Same SVG used at all sizes.
    why: |
      A 1.5px stroke is 6.25% of a 24px icon but 9.4% of a 16px icon.
      At small sizes, fine strokes become sub-pixel and blur.
      At large sizes, strokes look too thin relative to icon size.
    solution: |
      # Size-specific stroke weights:

      # 16px icons:
      stroke-width="1"    # 6.25% of icon
      # Minimum visible stroke

      # 24px icons (standard):
      stroke-width="1.5"  # 6.25% of icon
      # Sweet spot for detail

      # 32px icons:
      stroke-width="2"    # 6.25% of icon
      # Maintains proportions

      # Implementation options:

      1. Separate SVG files per size:
         icon-16.svg, icon-24.svg, icon-32.svg

      2. CSS scaling with stroke adjustment:
         .icon-sm svg { stroke-width: 1px; }
         .icon-md svg { stroke-width: 1.5px; }
         .icon-lg svg { stroke-width: 2px; }

      3. SVG stroke scaling attribute:
         vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"
         # Stroke stays constant regardless of scale
    symptoms:
      - Strokes invisible at small sizes
      - Icons look too thin at large sizes
      - Inconsistent visual weight across sizes
      - Details merge at small sizes

  - id: missing-touch-target
    summary: Icon buttons smaller than minimum touch target (44x44px)
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Users mis-tap icon buttons on mobile. Frustration with small click targets.
      Accessibility audit failures for touch target size.
    why: |
      Apple guidelines: 44x44 point minimum. Android: 48x48 dp.
      WCAG 2.5.5: 44x44 CSS pixels. A 16px or 24px icon with no padding
      is impossible to tap accurately. Average finger pad is ~10mm (40px).
    solution: |
      # Separate icon size from touch target:

      <button class="icon-button">
        <svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24">...</svg>
      </button>

      .icon-button {
        /* Touch target: 44x44 minimum */
        width: 44px;
        height: 44px;
        padding: 10px;  /* (44-24)/2 = 10px padding */

        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
      }

      .icon {
        /* Visual icon: 24px */
        width: 24px;
        height: 24px;
      }

      # Alternative: invisible touch expansion
      .icon-button::before {
        content: '';
        position: absolute;
        inset: -10px;  /* Expands touch area */
      }
    symptoms:
      - Users tap wrong icon on mobile
      - Accessibility audit failures
      - High error rate on icon actions

  - id: icon-only-navigation
    summary: Using icons without labels for navigation or critical actions
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Users unsure what icons mean. High support tickets for "where is X feature?"
      Different users interpret same icon differently.
    why: |
      Icon meanings aren't universal. A gear could be settings, admin, or preferences.
      Users don't click icons they don't understand. Critical actions need clarity.
      Icon-only interfaces have lower task completion rates.
    solution: |
      # Always pair non-universal icons with labels:

      # BAD - icon only
      <button aria-label="Settings">
        <GearIcon />
      </button>

      # GOOD - icon + visible label
      <button>
        <GearIcon />
        <span>Settings</span>
      </button>

      # Icon-only acceptable ONLY for:
      - Close (X) - in expected position
      - Search - when next to search input
      - Menu (hamburger) - familiar pattern

      # For space-constrained areas:
      - Tooltip on hover (not mobile-friendly)
      - Reveal label on focus
      - aria-label for screen readers (minimum)

      # Test: Show icon to 5 people, ask what it means
      # If answers vary, add a label
    symptoms:
      - "What does this icon do?"
      - Low click rates on icon-only buttons
      - Support tickets about finding features
      - Users avoid icon-only actions

  - id: animation-without-reduced-motion
    summary: Icon animations that ignore user motion preferences
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Icons spin, bounce, or animate continuously. Some users report discomfort.
      Animations don't respect system accessibility settings.
    why: |
      Vestibular disorders affect 35% of adults over 40. Excessive motion
      causes nausea, dizziness, and headaches. WCAG requires respecting
      prefers-reduced-motion. Ignoring it is an accessibility violation.
    solution: |
      # Always check motion preferences:

      /* Icon animation */
      .icon-loading {
        animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
      }

      /* Respect user preference */
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        .icon-loading {
          animation: none;
          /* Alternative: opacity pulse instead of spin */
          opacity: 0.5;
        }
      }

      # For critical animations (loading indicators):
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        .icon-loading {
          /* Static or subtle alternative */

          50% { opacity: 1; }
        }
      }

      # Rule: Any moving icon must have reduced-motion variant
    symptoms:
      - User complaints about motion
      - Accessibility audit failures

  - id: inconsistent-icon-set-style
    summary: Mixing different icon styles (outlined, filled, two-tone) in same UI
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Some icons are outline-only, others are filled. Stroke weights vary.
      Corner radii differ between icons. Icons look like they're from different sets.
    why: |
      Inconsistency creates visual noise. Users subconsciously notice something
      is "off." Icons should feel like a family. Mixing styles breaks the
      visual language. Professional products maintain strict icon consistency.
    solution: |
      # Choose ONE style and enforce it:

      # Style attributes to standardize:

      1. Fill vs stroke:
         - All outline (most versatile)
         - All filled (bold, simple)
         - All duotone (complex, branded)

      2. Stroke weight:
         - Pick one (e.g., 1.5px at 24px)
         - Every icon uses same weight

      3. Corner radius:
         - Sharp (0px) OR rounded (2px)
         - Apply to all icons

      4. Line caps:
         - Round OR square
         - Same across set

      # Icon audit:
      - Export all icons to grid view
      - Look for outliers
      - Fix or replace inconsistent icons

      # When adding new icons:
      - Reference existing icons
      - Match ALL style attributes
      - Review in context of full set
    symptoms:
      - Icons look like different families
      - Visual inconsistency across UI
      - "Something looks off" feedback
      - Design reviews catch style mixing

  - id: svg-bloat
    summary: Unoptimized SVG with unnecessary code, metadata, and precision
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      SVG files larger than needed. Slow page loads. Large icon bundles.
      SVG contains editor metadata, unused definitions, excessive decimal places.
    why: |
      Illustrator/Figma export includes unnecessary data. Editor metadata

    summary: Using icon color alone to convey status or meaning
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Red icon means error, green means success. Status shown only by icon color.
      Same icon shape in different colors for different states.
    why: |
      8% of men have color vision deficiency. Monochrome displays exist.
      Print/fax loses color. High contrast mode changes colors.
      Color-only meaning excludes users and violates WCAG.

      Icon-only buttons have no accessible name. SVG icons ignored by assistive tech.
    why: |
      Screen reader users can't understand icon purpose. WCAG requires
