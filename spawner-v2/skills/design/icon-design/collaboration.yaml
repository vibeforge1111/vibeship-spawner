# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Semiotics
    insight: |
      Semiotics studies how symbols convey meaning:
      - Icon: Visual resemblance to referent (camera = photography)
      - Index: Causal connection (smoke = fire)
      - Symbol: Arbitrary convention (red octagon = stop)

      Great icons use iconic resemblance where possible,
      fall back to symbolic convention for abstract concepts.
      Know the difference to choose the right metaphor.
    applies_when: "Selecting metaphors for new icons"

  - domain: Wayfinding Design
    insight: |
      Airport and transit signage has solved icon universality:
      - ISO 7001 defines international public information symbols
      - Tested across languages and cultures
      - Extreme simplification for fast recognition
      - Combine icon + text for critical information

      When designing navigation icons, study wayfinding systems.
      They've solved the universal comprehension problem.
    applies_when: "Creating navigation or directional icons"

  - domain: Pictogram History (Isotype)
    insight: |
      Otto Neurath's ISOTYPE (1920s) established pictogram principles:
      - Reduce to essential characteristics
      - Standardize within a set
      - Use consistent stroke and fill
      - Meaning through context and repetition

      Modern icon design follows the same principles
      established 100 years ago. Study the classics.
    applies_when: "Understanding icon design foundations"

  - domain: Cognitive Psychology
    insight: |
      How humans recognize icons:
      - Pre-attentive processing: <250ms for basic shapes
      - Gestalt principles: Closure, similarity, proximity
      - Semantic memory: Prior experience with symbols
      - Context effects: Surrounding UI influences interpretation

      Design for the 250ms recognition window.
      Leverage Gestalt. Consider context.
    applies_when: "Optimizing icon recognizability"

  - domain: Heraldry
    insight: |
      Medieval heraldry solved emblem design at distance:
      - High contrast (limited palette)
      - Simple, bold shapes
      - Distinctive silhouettes
      - Works in monochrome

      Icons are modern heraldry. The same principles apply:
      recognizable at a glance, distinctive in silhouette.
    applies_when: "Creating bold, recognizable symbols"

  - domain: Typography
    insight: |
      Icon sets are visual alphabets:
      - Consistent x-height = consistent icon grid
      - Stroke weight = font weight
      - Optical adjustments for round vs angular
      - Family cohesion across all glyphs

      Design icons like a type designer designs letterforms.
      The set must read as one voice.
    applies_when: "Ensuring icon set consistency"
