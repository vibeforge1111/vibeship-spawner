  - id: contrast-crime
    summary: Using low-contrast text that fails accessibility standards
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Light gray text on white backgrounds, soft pastels for text,
      or any combination that looks "elegant" but fails WCAG requirements.
    why: |
      WCAG requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text. Low contrast fails 15% of users
      including those with vision impairments, color blindness, or viewing in bright sunlight.
      8% of men have color vision deficiency. Screen brightness varies wildly. Aging eyes need
      more contrast. What looks fine on your Retina display fails on most screens.
    solution: |
      # BAD: Fails accessibility
      #999999 on #FFFFFF → 2.85:1 (FAILS)
      #CCCCCC on #FFFFFF → 1.60:1 (FAILS)

      # GOOD: Passes accessibility
      #595959 on #FFFFFF → 7.0:1 (AAA)
      #767676 on #FFFFFF → 4.54:1 (AA minimum)

      # Always use a contrast checker
      # Tools: WebAIM Contrast Checker, Stark, Polypane
    symptoms:
      - Users complain text is hard to read
      - Squinting at screens
      - Accessibility audit failures
      - Support tickets about readability

  - id: touch-target-terror
    summary: Interactive elements smaller than 44x44px on mobile
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Icon buttons at 24px, links in dense text, close buttons in corners,
      checkbox labels that don't expand click area.
    why: |
      Small targets cause misclicks, frustration, and accessibility failure.
      Apple requires 44x44 points, Android requires 48x48 dp, WCAG requires 44x44 CSS pixels.
      Touch is imprecise. Fingers are larger than cursor pointers.
    solution: |
      # Padding increases hit area
      <button style="padding: 12px">
        <Icon size="20px" />
      </button>
      # Icon is 20px, target is 44px

      # Invisible touch expansion
      button::before {
        content: '';
        position: absolute;
        inset: -12px;
      }

      # Full-width list items - entire row clickable, not just text
    symptoms:
      - Mobile users tapping wrong targets
      - Frustration on touch devices
      - Accessibility audit failures
      - High error rates on mobile forms
    detection_pattern: 'width:\s*[0-3][0-9]px|height:\s*[0-3][0-9]px'

  - id: font-size-fiasco
    summary: Body text below 16px or ignoring user font settings
    severity: high
    situation: |
      12px body text "looks cleaner", using px instead of rem, !important on font sizes,
      ignoring browser zoom or user preferences.
    why: |
      Small text is unreadable for many users. Fixed font sizes break accessibility.
      Users set browser font sizes for a reason. WCAG requires text to scale to 200%
      without loss of content or functionality.
    solution: |
      # Base - respects browser setting
      html { font-size: 100%; } /* 16px default */

      # Scale with viewport, within limits
      html {
        font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.9rem + 0.5vw, 1.25rem);
      }

      # Use rem for scaling
      p { font-size: 1rem; } /* Scales with user preference */

      # Minimum sizes
      Body text: 16px (1rem) minimum
      Captions: 14px with good contrast
      Never go below 12px for anything
    symptoms:
      - Users zooming browser
      - Complaints about readability
      - Pinch-to-zoom on mobile
      - Accessibility failures

  - id: inconsistent-components
    summary: Same component looks or behaves differently across the product
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Button styles vary by page, form inputs have different heights,
      spacing changes randomly, colors drift between screens.
    why: |
      Inconsistency creates cognitive load. Users must relearn each screen.
      Looks unprofessional. Maintenance becomes nightmare. Design debt accumulates.
    solution: |
      # Design tokens - single source of truth
      :root {
        --button-radius: 6px;
        --button-primary-bg: #2563eb;
        --button-font-size: 0.875rem;
        --button-padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
      }

      # All buttons use tokens
      .button {
        border-radius: var(--button-radius);
        background: var(--button-primary-bg);
        font-size: var(--button-font-size);
        padding: var(--button-padding);
      }

      # Component library with documentation
      # Document all variants and usage guidelines
    symptoms:
      - "Which button style is correct?"
      - Design review catches inconsistencies
      - CSS with many one-off overrides
      - Different teams make different buttons

  - id: disabled-state-disaster
    summary: Disabled elements that are invisible or confusing
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Light gray on light gray (invisible), no cursor change,
      no explanation why disabled, or removing element entirely.
    why: |
      Users don't understand what's wrong or what to do. They think the button
      is broken or they missed something. No feedback creates frustration.
    solution: |
      # Visible but clearly inactive
      button:disabled {
        opacity: 0.5;
        cursor: not-allowed;
      }

      # Explain WHY it's disabled
      <button disabled aria-describedby="why">Submit</button>
      <span id="why">Please fill required fields</span>

      # Rules:
      # If users can NEVER use it → hide
      # If users need to DO something → disable + explain
    symptoms:
      - "Is this button broken?"
      - Support tickets about disabled features
      - Users refreshing hoping it works
      - Confusion about what to do
    detection_pattern: 'opacity:\s*0\.[0-2]|visibility:\s*hidden'

  - id: color-only-meaning
    summary: Using color as the only way to convey information
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Red = error, green = success (only), required fields with red asterisk only,
      charts with colored lines and no labels, status dots with no text.
    why: |
      Color blind users can't distinguish. Monochrome displays fail. Print fails.
      8% of men and 0.5% of women have color vision deficiency.
    solution: |
      # BAD: Color only
      🔴 (red dot for error)

      # GOOD: Color + icon + text
      ❌ Email is invalid
      ✓ Saved successfully

      # Required fields
      Email* (required) - not just red asterisk

      # Charts
      [///] Revenue (green, striped)
      [===] Costs (red, dashed)
    symptoms:
      - Color blind users can't use interface
      - "What does the red dot mean?"
      - Information lost when printed
      - Accessibility audit failures

  - id: modal-trap
    summary: Modals that trap users or lack proper escape routes
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Modals without close buttons, no escape key handling, can't click outside to close,
      focus not trapped (keyboard users leave modal), stacked modals.
    why: |
      Users feel stuck. Keyboard users literally are stuck without focus management.
      No escape route creates frustration and accessibility violations.
    solution: |
      # Modal requirements:
      # 1. Focus trap - Tab cycles through modal elements
      # 2. Escape key closes modal
      # 3. X button visible
      # 4. Click outside closes (optional but expected)
      # 5. Return focus to trigger when closed
      # 6. No modal inception (modal → modal → modal)

      <div role="dialog"
           aria-modal="true"
           aria-labelledby="modal-title"
           aria-describedby="modal-desc">
    symptoms:
      - Users can't close modal
      - Keyboard users trapped
      - Multiple modals stacking
      - Body scrolling behind modal
    detection_pattern: 'role="dialog"(?![\\s\\S]*aria-modal)'

  - id: invisible-focus
    summary: Removing focus outlines with outline:none without alternative
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Global *:focus { outline: none } or button:focus { outline: 0 }
      without providing visible focus-visible alternative.
    why: |
      Keyboard users cannot navigate. They literally can't see where they are.
      WCAG violation. 15-20% of users rely on keyboard navigation.
    solution: |
      # THE CRIME
      *:focus { outline: none; } /* NEVER DO THIS */

      # THE FIX - focus-visible
      button:focus { outline: none; }
      button:focus-visible {
        outline: 2px solid #2563eb;
        outline-offset: 2px;
      }

      # Or custom focus style
      button:focus-visible {
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.5);
      }
    symptoms:
      - Keyboard users lost on page
      - Tab key seems to do nothing
      - Accessibility audit failures
      - Can't see current focus
    detection_pattern: 'outline:\s*(none|0)|outline-width:\s*0'

  - id: animation-assault
    summary: Animations that are too fast, too slow, too much, or ignore preferences
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Duration > 500ms feels slow, < 100ms feels jarring. Parallax scrolling,
      auto-playing video backgrounds, infinite spinners, excessive bounce effects.
    why: |
      Motion sickness for vestibular disorder users. Distraction. Battery drain on mobile.
      WCAG requires respecting prefers-reduced-motion preference.
    solution: |
      # Good animation timing
      Duration: 150-300ms for most UI
      Easing: ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits

      # REQUIRED: Respect user preferences
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        *, *::before, *::after {
          animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
          transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
        }
      }

      # Purpose of motion:
      # ✓ Showing connection (this came from there)
      # ✓ Confirming action (button pressed)
      # ✗ Decoration (things floating around)
    symptoms:
      - Users report motion sickness
      - "Make it stop moving"
      - Battery drain complaints
      - Slow-feeling interface
    detection_pattern: 'animation-duration:\s*[1-9][0-9]{3}ms|transition-duration:\s*[1-9]s'

  - id: spacing-chaos
    summary: Inconsistent spacing with random pixel values
    severity: high
    situation: |
      margin: 17px, padding: 13px 22px, gap: 9px - random values with no system.
    why: |
      Creates visual disorder. Breaks grouping (Law of Proximity). Looks amateur.
      Harder to maintain. Designers and developers guess differently.
    solution: |
      # Use 4px/8px base scale
      :root {
        --space-1: 0.25rem;  /* 4px */
        --space-2: 0.5rem;   /* 8px */
        --space-3: 1rem;     /* 16px */
        --space-4: 1.5rem;   /* 24px */
        --space-5: 2rem;     /* 32px */
        --space-6: 3rem;     /* 48px */
        --space-7: 4rem;     /* 64px */
      }

      # Law of Proximity:
      # Related items: Close together
      # Unrelated items: Far apart
    symptoms:
      - Spacing looks "off"
      - Hard to maintain consistency
      - Designers and devs argue about pixels
      - Every component has different spacing
    detection_pattern: 'margin:\s*\d+px|padding:\s*\d+px'

  - id: hover-only-actions
    summary: Important actions only visible on hover
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Delete button appears on row hover, edit controls hidden until hover,
      navigation submenus on hover only, tooltips with essential info.
    why: |
      Touch devices have no hover state. Keyboard users have no cursor.
      Discovery impossible. Mobile is 50%+ of traffic.
    solution: |
      # Alternatives to hover-only:
      # 1. Always visible (best for critical actions)
      [Item Name]  [Edit] [Delete]

      # 2. Progressive disclosure
      [Item Name]  [...] → [Edit] [Delete]
      # Three-dot menu is discoverable

      # 3. Swipe actions (mobile)
      ← Swipe reveals actions →

      # 4. Selection mode
      [□] Select items → bulk action bar appears
    symptoms:
      - '"How do I delete this?" on mobile'
      - Actions not discoverable
      - Touch users can't find features
      - High support tickets for basic actions
    detection_pattern: ':hover[^{]*\{[^}]*display:\s*block|:hover[^{]*\{[^}]*visibility:\s*visible'

  - id: z-index-war
    summary: Z-index values spiraling into hundreds of thousands
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      z-index: 100, then 999, then 9999, then 99999, then someone adds 999999999 for an "emergency fix".
    why: |
      Unmaintainable. Components fight for visibility. Bugs appear randomly.
      New developer has no idea what's on top of what.
    solution: |
      # Create a stacking scale
      :root {
        --z-dropdown: 100;
        --z-sticky: 200;
        --z-fixed: 300;
        --z-modal-backdrop: 400;
        --z-modal: 500;
        --z-popover: 600;
        --z-tooltip: 700;
        --z-toast: 800;
      }

      # Rules:
      # 1. Use the scale, nothing outside it
      # 2. Create stacking contexts intentionally
      # 3. Document the hierarchy
      # 4. Review z-index in code review
    symptoms:
      - Modal appears behind content
      - Dropdown behind other elements
      - '"Just increase z-index" fixes'
      - Random layering bugs
    detection_pattern: 'z-index:\s*[0-9]{4,}'
