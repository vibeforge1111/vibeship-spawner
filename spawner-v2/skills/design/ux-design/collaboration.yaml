cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Cognitive Psychology
    insight: |
      Psychologists know human limits:
      - Working memory holds 7±2 items
      - Attention is a limited resource
      - Mental models guide expectations
      - Habits are hard to break
      UX design respects cognitive limits.
    applies_when: "Reducing cognitive load"

      - End-to-end thinking wins
      UX extends beyond the screen.
    applies_when: "Mapping user journeys"

  - domain: Behavioral Economics
    insight: |
      Behavioral economists know decisions:
      - Defaults are powerful
      - Choice architecture matters
      - Friction changes behavior
      - Loss aversion is real
      UX design shapes decisions.
