  - id: logo-first-fallacy
    summary: Starting with logo design before brand strategy is defined
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We need a logo" as the first step. Jumping straight to visual design
      without defining positioning, values, or personality first.
    why: |
      You're designing a symbol for something undefined. Logo won't reflect strategy
      because there is no strategy. Multiple rounds of subjective feedback with no anchor.
      End up with a logo that looks nice but means nothing.
    solution: |
      # Strategy before design, always:
      1. Define positioning - What space do you own?
      2. Define values - What do you stand for?
      3. Define personality - How do you communicate?
      4. Define audience - Who are you speaking to?

      THEN start logo design.

      # Logo visualizes strategy - can't visualize nothing
    symptoms:
      - "I'll know it when I see it"
      - Endless revision cycles
      - Logo that doesn't feel right
      - Brand identity that doesn't connect

  - id: crowdsourced-identity
    summary: Using logo contests, spec work, or design-by-committee
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Let's see what the team comes up with." Running a 99designs contest.
      Having 10 stakeholders each submit ideas. Picking winner by vote.
    why: |
      No strategic foundation. Judged on surface appeal, not brand fit.
      Winner picked by popularity, not expertise. Often derivative or generic.
      Relationship with designer ends after delivery—no system thinking.
    solution: |
      # Work with qualified designers who:
      - Ask strategic questions first
      - Understand your market and audience
      - Build systems, not just logos
      - Stay for ongoing brand evolution

      # Pay for expertise, not just output
      # The logo is 10% of the work; the system is 90%
    symptoms:
      - Logo that looks like competitors
      - No brand system, just a logo file
      - Can't extend brand to new applications
      - Identity doesn't feel cohesive

  - id: trendy-identity
    summary: Creating identity based on current design trends
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We want that minimalist flat look." Gradient everything.
      Whatever Dribbble celebrates this year. Sans-serif lowercase wordmarks
      because everyone else is doing it.
    why: |
      Trends date rapidly. In 3 years you look outdated. You look like everyone else
      following the same trend. No distinctiveness—the opposite of branding's purpose.
    solution: |
      # Design for longevity:
      - Ask "will this feel right in 10 years?"
      - Look at enduring identities (Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola)
      - Understand WHY they last

      # Trends for campaigns, not for identity
      # Core identity should transcend trends
      # Express trends through applications, not logo
    symptoms:
      - Rebrand needed every 3-5 years
      - Looking like every other startup
      - "Our logo looks dated"
      - No distinctive visual territory

  - id: unscalable-logo
    summary: Logos that don't work at small sizes or in limited contexts
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Intricate details that disappear at small sizes. Wordmarks that become illegible.
      Colors that don't work in monochrome. Designed on large screens, never tested small.
    why: |
      Favicon is a blur. App icon is unrecognizable. Embroidery is a mess.
      Social avatars fail. The most common uses of your logo are broken.
    solution: |
      # Design small first:
      - Test at 16px (favicon size)
      - Test in monochrome
      - Test on dark and light backgrounds
      - Test embroidered/printed

      # If it doesn't work small, simplify until it does

      # Create responsive logo system:
      - Full logo for large applications
      - Simplified version for medium
      - Icon/mark only for small
    symptoms:
      - Favicon is unrecognizable
      - App icon doesn't read
      - Details lost in small applications
      - Constantly making exceptions
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: restricted-palette
    summary: Colors that only work in limited contexts
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Colors too similar to distinguish. No clear hierarchy. Colors that look nice
      together in one composition but fail as a system.
    why: |
      No accessible text color combinations. No way to show hierarchy.
      Colors muddy when combined. Can't create variety within brand.
    solution: |
      # Build a color system, not just a palette:
      - Primary colors (1-2)
      - Secondary colors (2-3)
      - Accent colors (1-2)
      - Neutral colors (5-7 grayscale)
      - Functional colors (success, error, warning)

      # Test accessibility:
      - All text/background combinations
      - Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio

      # Provide clear usage guidance:
      - When to use each color
      - Allowed combinations
      - Hierarchy rules
    symptoms:
      - "What color should I use?"
      - Accessibility failures
      - Colors looking muddy together
      - Inconsistent color application
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: unclear-guidelines
    summary: Brand guidelines that don't actually guide
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Vague rules. Examples without principles. "Use good judgment."
      PDF that shows logo but not how to apply it.
    why: |
      Everyone interprets differently. Inconsistent application.
      Guidelines become shelfware nobody follows.
      Brand erodes from a thousand small deviations.
    solution: |
      # Write guidelines for someone who's never seen the brand:
      - Every rule has a reason explained
      - Good AND bad examples
      - Specific enough to follow
      - Flexible enough to enable

      # Include:
      - Logo usage (and misuse)
      - Color specifications (with codes)
      - Typography (with hierarchy)
      - Spacing and layout principles
      - Voice and tone guidelines
      - Application examples
    symptoms:
      - "Is this on brand?"
      - Inconsistent applications
      - Guidelines never referenced
      - Every project looks different

  - id: unchangeable-logo
    summary: Treating the logo as sacred and untouchable
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Minimum size rules that prevent legitimate use. No flexibility for context.
      "Never modify the logo" in all situations.
    why: |
      Teams work around restrictions instead of with them.
      Brand appears rigid and outdated.
      Can't adapt to new contexts and channels.
    solution: |
      # Build flexibility into the system:
      - Responsive logos that adapt to size
      - Clear permissions for adaptation
      - Animated versions for digital
      - Special event variations

      # Trust trained teams to apply judgment
      # Rules should enable, not just restrict

      # What's protected:
      - Core proportions
      - Color relationships
      - Key recognizable elements

      # What's flexible:
      - Size adaptations
      - Context-appropriate variations
      - Channel-specific versions
    symptoms:
      - People breaking rules anyway
      - Missing opportunities for expression
      - Brand feels stiff and corporate
      - Can't adapt to new channels

  - id: verbal-afterthought
    summary: Focusing entirely on visual identity, neglecting voice and tone
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Beautiful visual identity. No voice guidelines.
      Brand sounds different everywhere—formal here, casual there, robotic in emails.
    why: |
      Voice inconsistency undermines visual consistency.
      Incomplete identity system. Users experience dissonance.
      Every writer invents their own voice.
    solution: |
      # Verbal identity is half the work:
      - Voice: The consistent personality
      - Tone: How voice adapts to context

      # Define:
      - Personality traits (3-5)
      - Language principles
      - Words we use / words we avoid
      - Tone variations by context
      - Example copy for common situations

      # Voice guidelines as robust as visual guidelines
      # Words and images designed together
    symptoms:
      - Brand sounds different everywhere
      - Writers unsure how to write
      - Copy feels generic
      - Personality doesn't come through

  - id: impossible-name
    summary: Choosing names that are unavailable or problematic
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Love the name without checking availability. Domain unavailable or costs
      fortune. Trademark conflicts. Unpronounceable or unspellable.
    why: |
      Domain unavailable or costs fortune. Trademark conflicts.
      Customers can't find you. Constant "that's spelled..." conversations.
      Legal risk if you proceed anyway.
    solution: |
      # Name strategy before falling in love:
      1. Check domain availability (.com preferred)
      2. Check social handles (@name on major platforms)
      3. Search trademark database (USPTO, EUIPO)
      4. Test pronunciation (5 people say it back)
      5. Check for unwanted meanings in other languages
      6. Legal review before commitment

      # Have 3-5 viable options, not just one
    symptoms:
      - Domain is $50,000
      - Can't get @name on social
      - Trademark cease and desist
      - Everyone spells it wrong

  - id: stakeholder-sketch
    summary: Executives providing design sketches instead of strategy
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "I was thinking something like this..." (hands napkin sketch)
      Stakeholders providing visual solutions instead of defining problems.
    why: |
      Constrains exploration. Designer becomes executor of amateur ideas.
      Design quality suffers. Professional expertise wasted.
      Solution before problem is understood.
    solution: |
      # Stakeholders define:
      - Business objectives
      - Target audience
      - Brand attributes
      - Competitive context
      - Success metrics

      # Stakeholders do NOT define:
      - Visual solutions
      - Colors (unless strategic)
      - Specific design elements

      # Evaluate work against strategy, not personal preference
      # "Does this achieve our objectives?" not "Do I like it?"
    symptoms:
      - "Make the logo bigger"
      - Personal taste drives decisions
      - Best work rejected for wrong reasons
      - Design by committee

  - id: franken-brand
    summary: Identity pieced together from multiple uncoordinated sources
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Different designer for logo, another for website, another for packaging.
      Each with different interpretations. Accumulated over years.
    why: |
      Incoherent identity. Styles clash. Nothing feels like it belongs together.
      The opposite of brand consistency. Diluted brand equity.
    solution: |
      # Single identity system before extending:
      - One designer/team for core identity
      - Guidelines before application
      - Central governance if multiple vendors

      # If inheriting a franken-brand:
      1. Audit all brand expressions
      2. Identify strongest elements
      3. Create unified system
      4. Phase out inconsistencies
    symptoms:
      - Website doesn't match packaging
      - Every touchpoint looks different
      - "Which version is correct?"
      - No coherent brand impression

  - id: premature-rebrand
    summary: Rebranding before current brand has built equity
    severity: high
    situation: |
      New leadership wants to make a mark. "Fresh start" mentality.
      Blame the brand for business problems. Bored with current identity.
    why: |
      Discards whatever equity exists. Confuses existing customers.
      Signals instability. Wastes resources on optics instead of substance.
      Business problems rarely solved by new logo.
    solution: |
      # Rebrand only for strategic reasons:
      - Merger/acquisition requiring new identity
      - Market repositioning (different audience/category)
      - Shedding negative associations
      - Legal requirement

      # NOT reasons to rebrand:
      - "I'm tired of it"
      - New CEO wants their mark
      - Competitor rebranded
      - Design trends changed

      # Evolution usually better than revolution
      # Refresh elements while maintaining equity
    symptoms:
      - Rebrand every 2-3 years
      - No brand equity building
      - Customers confused by changes
      - Internal politics driving brand decisions
