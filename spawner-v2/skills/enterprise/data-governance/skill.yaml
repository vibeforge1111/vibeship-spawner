description: Use when implementing data governance frameworks, building data catalogs, establishing data lineage, defining data quality rules, or setting up data stewardship programs - covers metadata management, data quality, and compliance

patterns:
  golden_rules:
    - rule: "Data is a business asset"
      reason: "Treat it with same rigor as financial assets"
    - rule: "Accountability must be clear"
      reason: "Every data element needs an owner"
    - rule: "Quality is everyone's job"
      reason: "Not just a technical problem"
    - rule: "Automate where possible"
      reason: "Manual governance doesn't scale"
    - rule: "Measure outcomes"
      reason: "Track data quality, usage, value"

  governance_roles:
    cdo:
      description: "Executive sponsor for data governance"
      accountability: "Overall program success"
    data_owner:
      description: "Business leader accountable for data domain"
      accountability: "Data quality and compliance in domain"
    data_steward:
      description: "Day-to-day data quality and metadata"
      accountability: "Operational data quality"
    data_custodian:
      description: "Technical management of data storage"
      accountability: "Technical data security and availability"

  quality_dimensions:
    completeness: "Are all required values present?"
    accuracy: "Are values correct?"
    consistency: "Are values consistent across systems?"
    timeliness: "Is data current and updated timely?"
    validity: "Do values conform to rules?"
    uniqueness: "Are duplicates managed?"

  data_classification:
    public: "Freely available"
    internal: "Internal use only"
    confidential: "Restricted access"
    restricted: "Highly sensitive"
    pii: "Personally identifiable information"
    phi: "Protected health information"

anti_patterns:
  - pattern: "No ownership"
    problem: "Nobody accountable for data issues"
    solution: "Assign clear data owners"
  - pattern: "Documentation only"
    problem: "Policies exist but not enforced"
    solution: "Automate enforcement"
  - pattern: "IT-only governance"
    problem: "Business not engaged"
    solution: "Embed in business processes"
  - pattern: "Big bang rollout"
    problem: "Try to govern everything at once"
    solution: "Start with critical data domains"
  - pattern: "Quality as afterthought"
    problem: "Check quality at consumption"
    solution: "Shift left, check at source"
  - pattern: "Manual lineage"
    problem: "Lineage outdated immediately"
    solution: "Auto-capture from pipelines"
