    severity: critical
    title: "Evidence Can Be Modified After Collection"
    summary: "Audit evidence stored in mutable storage undermines integrity"
    symptoms:
      - "Evidence files can be edited"
      - "No hash verification"
      - "Auditor questions evidence authenticity"
    why: |
      Compliance evidence must be immutable to prove it wasn't altered after
      collection. If evidence can be modified, its value is zero - auditors
      can't trust it, and you can't prove your controls were working.
    gotcha: |
      "Here's our evidence from last month"
      "How do I know this wasn't modified?"
      "It's in our S3 bucket..."
      "Can anyone edit that bucket?"
      "..."

      # Evidence is worthless if it can be tampered with
    solution: |
      1. Immutable storage:
         - S3 Object Lock (GOVERNANCE or COMPLIANCE mode)
         - Azure Immutable Blob Storage
         - Write-once storage

      2. Integrity verification:
         - SHA-256 hash at collection
         - Hash stored separately
         - Verify before audit

      3. Chain of custody:
         - Log all access
         - Timestamp with trusted time source
         - Digital signatures

  - id: stale-policies
    severity: high
    title: "Policies Don't Match Current Infrastructure"
    summary: "Policy-as-code hasn't been updated as infrastructure evolved"
    symptoms:
      - "New resources not covered by policies"
      - "Policies reference deprecated configurations"
      - "False negatives in compliance checks"
    why: |
      Infrastructure changes constantly - new services, renamed resources,
      changed configurations. If policies aren't updated, they silently
      stop checking what matters. You think you're compliant, but you're not.
    gotcha: |
      "We passed all compliance checks"
      "What about the new Kubernetes cluster?"
      "It's not in our policies yet"
      "So it's completely unchecked?"

      # New infrastructure deployed without compliance coverage
    solution: |
      1. Policy CI/CD:
         - Policies version-controlled
         - Review policies on infrastructure changes
         - Automated policy testing

      2. Coverage monitoring:
         - Track resource types vs policy coverage
         - Alert on new uncovered resources
         - Require policies before production

      3. Regular audits:
         - Quarterly policy review
         - Compare against infrastructure inventory
         - Update policies proactively

    severity: high
    title: "Checking Compliance But Not Enforcing"
    summary: "Violations are detected but nothing happens"
    symptoms:
      - "Dashboard shows failures"
      - "No remediation workflow"
      - "Same violations for months"
    why: |
      Compliance monitoring is useless if violations aren't addressed.
      If you detect problems but don't fix them, you're just documenting
      your non-compliance - which is worse than not knowing.
    gotcha: |
      "Our compliance dashboard shows 47 critical violations"
      "How long have they been there?"
      "Some for 6 months"
      "Why weren't they fixed?"
      "Nobody assigned to remediation"

      # Detecting problems without fixing them is compliance theater
    solution: |
      1. Automated remediation:
         - Auto-fix low-risk violations
         - Auto-create tickets for others
         - SLA for remediation

      2. Enforcement:
         - Block non-compliant deployments
         - Require exception approval
         - Time-bound exceptions only

      3. Accountability:
         - Violations assigned to owners
         - Escalation for overdue items
         - Executive visibility

    severity: medium
    title: "Scrambling Before Annual Audit"
    summary: "Evidence collection is a last-minute fire drill"
    symptoms:
      - "Weeks of audit prep"
      - "Missing evidence scramble"
      - "Evidence created retroactively"
    why: |
      If you're only collecting evidence before audits, you're proving you
      can scramble under pressure - not that your controls work year-round.
      Continuous compliance means the audit is just a review of existing data.
    gotcha: |
      "Audit is next month!"
      "Time to collect evidence"
      "But the logs from January were purged"
      "And we changed our access process in March"
      "And nobody documented the old one"

      # Annual panic reveals continuous compliance failure
    solution: |
      1. Continuous evidence collection:
         - Automated daily/weekly collection
         - Stored with retention policies
         - Never delete before audit

      2. Always audit-ready:
         - Evidence available instantly
         - Dashboards show current state
         - No special prep needed

      3. Process discipline:
         - Document process changes immediately
         - Evidence generated as side effect
         - Real-time compliance visibility
