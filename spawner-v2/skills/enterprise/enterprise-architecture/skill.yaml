description: Use when designing enterprise systems, applying TOGAF framework, creating capability maps, implementing domain-driven design, or planning technology transformations - covers ADM phases, architecture domains, and governance

  golden_rules:
    - rule: "Architecture serves business"
      reason: "Technology for its own sake fails"
    - rule: "Iterate, don't waterfall"
      reason: "Big-bang transformations rarely work"
    - rule: "Govern, don't gatekeep"
      reason: "Enable teams while ensuring alignment"
    - rule: "Document decisions"
      reason: "Future architects need context"
    - rule: "Measure outcomes"
      reason: "Architecture must prove value"
