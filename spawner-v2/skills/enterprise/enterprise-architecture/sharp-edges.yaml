    severity: high
    title: "Ivory Tower Architecture"
    summary: "Architecture team disconnected from development reality"
    symptoms:
      - "Architecture documents nobody follows"
      - "Developers work around official architecture"
      - "No feedback loop from implementation"
    why: |
      When architects sit separate from delivery teams, they create designs
      based on theoretical ideals rather than practical constraints. Teams
      ignore impractical mandates and create shadow architectures.
    gotcha: |
      "The Enterprise Architecture team has mandated a 6-month review
       cycle for all technology decisions. Meanwhile, we need to ship
       in 2 weeks."

      # Teams will just ignore the process and accumulate tech debt!
    solution: |
      1. Embed architects in delivery teams:
         - Rotate architects through product teams
         - Architects write code sometimes
         - Attend standups and retros

      2. Lightweight governance:
         - Self-service architecture review templates
         - Async reviews for standard patterns
         - Reserve sync reviews for novel decisions

      3. Feedback loops:
         - Track actual vs. intended architecture
         - Post-mortems inform future guidance
         - Architecture debt is visible

  - id: big-bang-transformation
    severity: critical
    title: "Big Bang Transformation Failure"
    summary: "Attempting to replace everything at once leads to project failure"
    symptoms:
      - "Multi-year transformation timeline"
      - "All-or-nothing migration approach"
      - "No intermediate value delivery"
    why: |
      Large transformations fail because requirements change during execution,
      key people leave, budgets get cut, and complexity compounds. The longer
      the timeline, the higher the failure probability.
    gotcha: |
      "We'll spend 18 months building the new platform, then migrate
       everything over a weekend. The old system will be decommissioned
       Monday."

      # Never works! Something always goes wrong at cutover.
    solution: |
      1. Strangler Fig pattern:
         - Route specific traffic to new system
         - Incrementally migrate features
         - Old and new coexist during transition

      2. Define intermediate architectures:
         - Transition State 1: Core migrated
         - Transition State 2: Integrations migrated
         - Target State: Legacy decommissioned

      3. Measure progress:
         - Traffic percentage on new system
         - Feature parity checklist
         - Value delivered at each stage

  - id: context-boundary-violation
    severity: high
    title: "Bounded Context Violations"
    summary: "Sharing databases or models across domain boundaries"
    symptoms:
      - "Multiple teams modifying same database tables"
      - "Shared library with domain logic"
      - "Changes in one domain break another"
    why: |
      When bounded contexts share implementation details, they become
      coupled. Changes require coordination across teams. This slows
      development and increases the risk of breaking changes.
    gotcha: |
      "We'll just add a column to the customers table. The other team
       uses it too, but they'll be fine."

      # They won't be fine! Their queries will break.
    solution: |
      1. Clear context boundaries:
         - Each context owns its data
         - Integration via events or APIs
         - No shared databases

      2. Anti-corruption layer:
         - Translate between context models
         - Don't leak internal structure
         - Version integration contracts

      3. Context mapping:
         - Document relationships between contexts
         - Define integration patterns
         - Assign ownership

  - id: governance-bottleneck
    severity: high
    title: "Architecture Review Bottleneck"
    summary: "All decisions require architecture board approval"
    symptoms:
      - "Long wait times for architecture review"
      - "Teams waiting on approval to proceed"
      - "Architecture board overwhelmed"
    why: |
      Centralized review creates bottlenecks. Teams queue for approval
      while competitors ship. Eventually teams bypass the process entirely,
      defeating the purpose of governance.
    gotcha: |
      "All technology decisions must go through the Architecture Review
       Board, which meets monthly."

      # Teams waiting 4-6 weeks for approval! They'll just do it anyway.
    solution: |
      1. Tiered governance:
         - Tier 1: Team decides (standard patterns)
         - Tier 2: Architect advises (minor deviations)
         - Tier 3: ARB approves (novel or risky)

      2. Pre-approved patterns:
         - Reference architectures for common cases
         - Technology radar with recommended defaults
         - Self-service compliance checks

      3. Asynchronous review:
         - ADR (Architecture Decision Record) review
         - Comment period instead of meetings
         - Escalate only on objection
