  - id: missing-tenant-filter
    severity: critical
    title: "Missing Tenant Filter in Query"
    summary: "Database query lacks tenant_id filter allowing cross-tenant data access"
    symptoms:
      - "Users see other tenants' data"
      - "Data counts don't match expectations"
      - "Security audit flags data leakage"
    why: |
      Every database query must filter by tenant_id. Without this, a query
      returns data from all tenants - a severe security vulnerability.
      One missing filter can expose all customer data.
    gotcha: |
      "Why can tenant A see tenant B's orders?"
      "Let me check the query..."
      "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'"
      "Where's the tenant filter?"
      "..."

      # Forgot to add WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id
    solution: |
      1. Use ORM middleware to auto-add tenant filter:
         - SQLAlchemy event listener
         - Django model managers
         - Prisma middleware

      2. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security:
         - Enable RLS on all tables
         - Create tenant isolation policy
         - Force RLS for table owner

      3. Code review checklist:
         - Every query has tenant_id
         - JOIN conditions include tenant_id
         - Subqueries filter by tenant

  - id: tenant-context-leak
    severity: critical
    title: "Tenant Context Leaks Between Requests"
    summary: "Thread-local or global tenant context persists across requests"
    symptoms:
      - "Random data from wrong tenant"
      - "Intermittent cross-tenant issues"
      - "Only happens under load"
    why: |
      Using global or thread-local storage for tenant context is dangerous
      in async environments. If not properly cleared, one request's tenant
      context leaks to another request - especially in connection pools.
    gotcha: |
      "Our tests pass but production shows random tenant data"
      "Only happens when traffic is high"
      "The same endpoint sometimes returns wrong data"

      # Async framework reused connection, tenant context wasn't cleared
    solution: |
      1. Use contextvars (Python) or AsyncLocalStorage (Node):
         - Request-scoped, async-safe
         - Can't leak between requests

      2. Middleware must:
         - Set context at request start
         - Clear context at request end
         - Handle errors to ensure cleanup

      3. Never use:
         - Global variables for tenant
         - Thread-local in async code
         - Module-level state

  - id: noisy-neighbor-unprotected
    severity: high
    title: "No Noisy Neighbor Protection"
    summary: "One tenant's heavy usage impacts all other tenants"
    symptoms:
      - "Latency spikes correlate with specific tenant activity"
      - "Small tenants complain about slow performance"
      - "Database CPU spikes from one tenant's queries"
    why: |
      In shared infrastructure, one tenant running expensive queries or
      making excessive API calls degrades performance for everyone.
      Without quotas and limits, the biggest tenant wins.
    gotcha: |
      "Why is our API so slow today?"
      "Looking at metrics... one tenant made 10x their normal API calls"
      "They're running a big migration"
      "And everyone else is suffering?"

      # No per-tenant rate limiting or resource quotas
    solution: |
      1. Per-tenant rate limiting:
         - API request limits (requests/second)
         - Burst allowance with token bucket
         - Different limits by plan tier

      2. Resource quotas:
         - CPU limits per tenant
         - Memory limits per tenant
         - Database connection limits
         - IOPS limits

      3. Fair scheduling:
         - Tenant-aware query queues
         - Priority based on plan
         - Throttle heavy users

  - id: migration-all-at-once
    severity: high
    title: "Schema Migration Hits All Tenants"
    summary: "Applying migrations to all tenant schemas simultaneously"
    symptoms:
      - "Long downtime during migrations"
      - "Failed migration leaves tenants inconsistent"
      - "Can't rollback without affecting everyone"
    why: |
      With schema-per-tenant, you have N schemas to migrate. Running them
      all at once is slow, risky, and blocks rollout. One failure can
      leave your database in an inconsistent state across tenants.
    gotcha: |
      "The migration is taking 4 hours..."
      "We have 500 tenant schemas"
      "And now schema 347 failed"
      "How do we rollback the other 346?"

      # Ran ALTER TABLE on all schemas in one transaction
    solution: |
      1. Rolling migrations:
         - Migrate tenants in batches
         - Verify each batch before continuing
         - Pause on errors

      2. Online schema changes:
         - Use pt-online-schema-change
         - Or gh-ost for MySQL
         - Minimal locking

      3. Canary deployments:
         - Migrate 1% of tenants first
         - Verify application works
         - Then roll out to rest
