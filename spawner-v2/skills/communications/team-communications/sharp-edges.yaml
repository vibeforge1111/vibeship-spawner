    title: Slack Black Hole - Information Lost In Scroll
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Decision made in Slack thread after long discussion. Everyone agrees.
      Three weeks later: "Wait, what did we decide?" Search turns up nothing
      useful. Different people remember different conclusions. The decision
      has to be remade. This happens every month.
    why: |
      Slack is designed for conversation, not storage. Important decisions
      buried in threads become unfindable. Slack search is weak for context.
      When information lives only in chat, it effectively doesn't exist
      for anyone who wasn't there at the moment.

    title: Meeting Creep - Calendar Colonization
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Company starts with few meetings. "Let's sync weekly." Turns into
      daily standups. Then sprint planning. Then retros. Then 1:1s. Then
      cross-team syncs. Engineer looks at calendar: 20 hours of meetings
      per week. Actual work happens at night. Burnout follows.
    why: |
      Meetings are easy to add, hard to remove. Each one feels necessary
      when added. Cumulative effect isn't felt until calendar is full.
      "This meeting is important" is always true in isolation. The problem
      is aggregate: a culture that defaults to sync.

      Company announces: "We're transparent! Everything is open!" All-hands
      meetings happen. Metrics dashboards shared. But: real problems are
      never discussed. Layoffs announced suddenly. Revenue issues hidden
      until crisis. People feel gaslit - "But I thought we were transparent?"
    why: |
      There's a difference between data transparency and truth transparency.
      Sharing metrics isn't the same as sharing reality. When companies
      perform transparency without practicing it, trust erodes faster than
      if they'd never claimed transparency at all.

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Team adopts async communication. But people are still on Slack all
      day. Anxious about missing something. Responding to messages immediately.
      Notifications never off. The async tools exist, but the sync behavior
      persists. No one gets deep work done.
    why: |
      Async tools don't create async culture. Without explicit norms about
      response times and expectations, people assume they need to be always
      available. Fear of being seen as unresponsive keeps everyone tethered.

      People stop reading. Then: real news (fundraising, major change) gets
      lost in the noise. "I didn't see that" becomes common.
    why: |
