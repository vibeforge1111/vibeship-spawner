# Developer Communications Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that destroy developer trust and tank adoption

  - id: broken-example
    summary: Publishing code examples that don't actually work
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Copy-paste examples with syntax errors, missing imports, outdated API calls.
      "It worked when I wrote it." API changed after docs written.
    why: |
      Developers copy-paste your example. It fails. They blame themselves first,
      then discover it's your fault. Trust evaporates. They assume all your docs
      are unreliable. One broken example poisons the well.
    solution: |
      # Every code example must be tested:
      Ideally automatically
      Extract examples from actual tests
      Version examples with API

      # Prefer runnable snippets:
      CodeSandbox
      Replit
      StackBlitz
      Can't go stale if they run

      # Testing process:
      1. Write example
      2. Run example
      3. Add to CI if possible
      4. Review on API changes
    symptoms:
      - Examples that error when copied
      - Outdated API calls in docs
      - '"Did anyone test this?" comments'
      - Trust issues with documentation
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: missing-prereq
    summary: Tutorials that assume setup steps without mentioning them
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Just call `api.configure()`" without explaining you need to install SDK,
      get API key, and initialize first. Seems obvious to the author.
    why: |
      New developers get stuck on step one. They can't distinguish "I did it wrong"
      from "the docs skipped something." They leave before they start.
    solution: |
      # Test with fresh environments:
      New machine
      New account
      No prior setup

      # Have unfamiliar person follow literally:
      They find the gaps
      Document what you assumed

      # Start from zero:
      "First, install the SDK: npm install..."
      "Get your API key from dashboard..."
      "Initialize with..."

      # State every prerequisite:
      □ Required tools
      □ Required accounts
      □ Required permissions
      □ Required knowledge
      Link to getting started from every tutorial
    symptoms:
      - Users stuck on step one
      - '"I followed the docs but..." issues'
      - Missing installation steps
      - Assumed knowledge not stated

  - id: outdated-screenshot
    summary: UI screenshots that don't match current product
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Dashboard screenshots from three versions ago. Instructions referencing
      buttons that moved. "Click the blue button" but button is now green.
    why: |
      Developers can't follow instructions. They waste time hunting for features.
      They question whether the product works at all.
    solution: |
      # Minimize reliance on screenshots:
      Use text instructions where possible
      Less to maintain

      # When screenshots necessary:
      Tag them with version
      Set update reminders
      Automated screenshot testing for critical flows

      # Treat as part of release process:
      Product change → Screenshot update
      Include in release checklist

      # Consider alternatives:
      Annotated videos
      Interactive tutorials
      Text-based instructions with CSS selectors
    symptoms:
      - Screenshots don't match UI
      - Users can't find features
      - Version mismatch confusion
      - Screenshots never updated

  - id: marketing-docs
    summary: Documentation that reads like marketing copy
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Our revolutionary API enables seamless integration with our powerful platform."
      Adjectives instead of information. Marketing writes it.
    why: |
      Developers see through marketing instantly. They're looking for how to do
      something, not why they should be impressed. Marketing copy signals that
      you don't respect their time.
    solution: |
      # Facts, not adjectives:
      Not: "Our powerful API"
      But: "The API supports 1000 req/sec"

      # Show what it does:
      Code examples
      Clear descriptions
      Let capability speak for itself

      # If you have to convince them it's good:
      It probably isn't
      Or your examples aren't good enough

      # Developer-first writing:
      What does it do?
      How do I use it?
      What are the limits?
    symptoms:
      - Adjective-heavy docs
      - Marketing-speak throughout
      - No technical substance
      - Developers bouncing quickly

  - id: jargon-trap
    summary: Using internal terminology developers don't know
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Configure your workspace's environment settings in the fleet dashboard."
      What's a fleet? What's a workspace here? Internal terms natural to team.
    why: |
      Developers feel stupid. They can't complete tasks because they don't
      understand the vocabulary. They search for terms and find nothing.
    solution: |
      # Define terms on first use:
      "Configure your workspace (the container for your projects)..."

      # Maintain a glossary:
      All product-specific terms
      Linked from docs

      # Have outsiders review:
      Find confusing terms
      Fix before publishing

      # Use standard terms where possible:
      Industry standard > invented term
      Common names > internal names
    symptoms:
      - Undefined jargon
      - Users asking "what is X?"
      - No glossary
      - Internal terminology throughout

  - id: copy-paste-trap
    summary: Duplicating content across pages without single source of truth
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Same setup instructions in 5 places, each slightly different.
      Easier to copy than link. Different authors, different times.
    why: |
      Content diverges. One version updated, others don't. Developers find
      conflicting information. Which one is right?
    solution: |
      # Single source of truth:
      One canonical location
      Include or link, don't copy

      # Content reuse systems:
      Snippets
      Includes
      Components

      # When you must duplicate:
      Track all instances
      Update all together
      Consider if duplication needed

      # Example structure:
      /getting-started/install.md (source of truth)
      Other pages: {% include 'getting-started/install.md' %}
    symptoms:
      - Conflicting instructions
      - Same content in multiple places
      - Updates miss some copies
      - "Which version is right?"

  - id: missing-error
    summary: Not documenting error messages and how to fix them
    severity: high
    situation: |
      API returns "Error 4019" with no explanation anywhere.
      Errors are edge cases. "They shouldn't happen." Nobody documents failures.
    why: |
      Developer hits error, searches, finds nothing. They're stuck. Support ticket.
      Frustrated tweet. Evaluating competitors.
    solution: |
      # Document every error code:
      What it means
      Why it happens
      How to fix it

      # Error message searchability:
      Error text should appear in docs
      SEO for error messages

      # Errors are first-class documentation:
      Not afterthought
      Part of API reference

      # Example error doc:
      Error 4019: Invalid API key format
      Cause: API key contains invalid characters
      Fix: Regenerate key in dashboard
      Related: Authentication guide
    symptoms:
      - Errors not documented
      - Users can't self-serve
      - Support tickets for errors
      - Error text not searchable

  - id: dead-link
    summary: Links in documentation that go to 404 pages
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Docs reorganized, links not updated. External resources moved.
      Nobody checks links regularly.
    why: |
      Developers hit dead ends. They lose trust. They assume the product
      is abandoned or unmaintained.
    solution: |
      # Automated link checking:
      CI job to check links
      Alert on broken links
      Block merge if links broken

      # Redirects for moved content:
      Never just delete
      Redirect old URLs

      # Regular audits:
      Monthly link check
      External link review

      # Treat broken links as bugs:
      Same priority as broken features
    symptoms:
      - 404s in docs
      - Broken internal navigation
      - External links to dead pages
      - No link monitoring

  - id: version-mismatch
    summary: Documentation without version specification
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Examples that work in v2 but not v3, without mentioning version.
      Only latest version documented. Historical docs not maintained.
    why: |
      Users on older versions can't find relevant docs. Users upgrading don't
      know what changed. Everyone confused about what applies.
    solution: |
      # Version your docs:
      Clear version selector
      Prominent placement

      # Keep docs for supported versions:
      v2 docs for v2 users
      Don't delete when v3 releases

      # Document migration paths:
      v2 → v3 guide
      Breaking changes highlighted

      # Example structure:
      docs.example.com/v2/
      docs.example.com/v3/
      Version selector in nav
    symptoms:
      - No version mentioned
      - Old version users confused
      - Migration path unclear
      - Only latest documented

  - id: wall-of-text
    summary: Dense paragraphs without structure
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      No headers, no code, no examples—just explanation after explanation.
      Author knows material deeply. Writes like an essay.
    why: |
      Developers scan, they don't read. Wall of text is unscannable.
      They miss what they need. They give up.
    solution: |
      # Structure everything:
      Headers that answer "what will I learn?"
      Bullets for lists
      Code blocks for code
      One idea per paragraph

      # Make it scannable:
      Bold key terms
      Clear headings
      Visual hierarchy

      # Developer reading pattern:
      Scan headings
      Find relevant section
      Read code first
      Read explanation if needed

      # Example structure:
      ## What this does
      Brief explanation
      ## Example
      ```code```
      ## Details
      Longer explanation if needed
    symptoms:
      - Long paragraphs
      - No code examples
      - Missing headers
      - Can't scan to find info

  - id: assumed-context
    summary: Documentation that only makes sense if you already know the answer
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "To fix this, just configure the resolver correctly."
      What resolver? Correctly how? Expert curse—author knows context.
    why: |
      The people who need docs most are those without context. They read,
      don't understand, assume they're the problem.
    solution: |
      # Explain from first principles:
      What is a resolver?
      Why do you need one?
      How to configure it?

      # Link to context:
      "Configure the resolver (see resolver guide)"
      Don't assume prior reading

      # Test with beginners:
      Would someone encountering this for first time understand?
      If not, add context

      # Layered explanations:
      Quick answer for experts
      Detailed explanation for beginners
      Links to prerequisites
    symptoms:
      - Assumes prior knowledge
      - Missing context
      - Beginners confused
      - References undefined concepts

  - id: changelog-non-change
    summary: Changelogs that don't tell you what changed
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Various bug fixes and improvements." "Updated dependencies."
      Version numbers without substance. Nobody wants to write changelogs.
    why: |
      Developers deciding to upgrade have no information. Can't assess risk.
      Can't find what broke their code. Don't trust releases.
    solution: |
      # Specific, actionable changelogs:
      What changed
      Why it changed
      What you need to do

      # Breaking changes highlighted:
      Clear markers
      Migration instructions

      # Example changelog:
      ## v3.2.0
      ### Breaking Changes
      - `user.name` renamed to `user.displayName`
        Migration: Find/replace in your code
      ### New Features
      - Added `user.avatar` field
      ### Bug Fixes
      - Fixed race condition in auth flow (#1234)

      # Not acceptable:
      "Bug fixes and improvements"
      "Updated dependencies"
      "Various changes"
    symptoms:
      - Vague changelog entries
      - No breaking change warnings
      - No migration instructions
      - Users surprised by changes
