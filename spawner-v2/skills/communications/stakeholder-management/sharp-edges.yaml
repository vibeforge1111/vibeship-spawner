    title: Update Gap Spiral - When Silence Compounds
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder sends monthly updates for 6 months. Things get busy. Skips
      July. August is a tough month, so skips that too. September feels
      awkward - "how do I explain the gap?" October: radio silence. By
      December, investors are worried. The longer the gap, the harder
      to restart. The relationship has decayed.
    why: |
      Update gaps compound psychologically. Each missed update makes the
      next one feel more daunting. Investors interpret silence as either
      bad news being hidden, or founder overwhelmed. The awkwardness of
      explaining the gap creates a vicious cycle that damages trust.
    solution: |
      1. Never skip, even if it hurts:
         """
         MINIMUM VIABLE UPDATE:

         Focus: [What we're doing]

      3. Automate the reminder:

      4. Pre-write during good times:

    title: Board Theater - Performing Instead of Collaborating
    severity: high
    situation: |
      CEO treats board meetings as performances. Beautiful slides.
      Rehearsed presentation. No real discussion. Hard questions
      deflected. Everything looks great on the surface. Board leaves
      feeling uninformed. CEO leaves feeling exhausted from the show.
      Nobody got value.
    why: |
      Founders fear board judgment, so they optimize for looking good
      rather than getting help. But boards exist to help, not to grade.
      When you perform instead of collaborate, you waste the board's
      expertise and make real problems harder to surface.

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Founder has great relationship with lead investor. Texts them
      frequently. Shares everything. But sends generic monthly email
      to other investors. Small investors feel like second-class
      citizens. One day they're asked for a reference or follow-on -
      they decline. "I barely heard from them."
    why: |
      It's natural to communicate more with people you're closer to.
      But investors talk to each other. Small investors talk to other
      founders. When they feel neglected, they can't help you even if
      they want to. And they won't try.

      Founder gives 0.5% to impressive advisor. First month: great
      call. Second month: they reschedule. Third month: they cancel.
      Six months later: no contact. Advisor still has equity. Founder
      frustrated but doesn't want to burn bridge. Now 0.5% is gone
      with no value received.
    why: |
      Advisor relationships require active management. Advisors are
      busy people who deprioritize what doesn't demand attention.
      Without structure, the relationship atrophies. But equity is
      already granted. You've paid for a service you're not receiving.

      Both sides assumed the other would drive. Neither had clear
      expectations. Now the "partnership" is just awkward silence.
    why: |
      Partnerships are celebrated before they deliver. Announcement
      incentives (PR, signaling) diverge from execution incentives
      (revenue, retention). Without explicit expectations and
