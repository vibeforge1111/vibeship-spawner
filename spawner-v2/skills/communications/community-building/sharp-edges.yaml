    title: Channel Proliferation - Death By Organization
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Community starts with 5 channels. Member suggests #off-topic. Another
      wants #career-advice. Someone asks for #regional-europe. Six months
      later: 50 channels, 45 of them dead. New members overwhelmed. Activity
      scattered. No channel has critical mass. The community feels empty.
    why: |
      Each new channel divides attention. Unless there's enough activity to
      sustain it, new channels become graveyards. The illusion of organization
      creates actual fragmentation. Members stop knowing where to post.
    solution: |
      1. Channel discipline:
         """
         CHANNEL CREATION RULES:

         New channel only when:
         - Existing channel is overwhelming

         - Committed moderator for it
         - At least 10+ people will use it regularly

         For each channel, ask:
         - 5+ messages in past week?
         - Distinct from other channels?
         - Would community miss it?

         If no to any: archive or merge.

    title: Founding Member Departure - When The Core Leaves
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Community built on 10 founding members who set the tone. Year two:
      one gets busy and leaves. Others follow. New members never built the
      same connection. Without the core, activity drops 50%. What was a
      vibrant community becomes a hollow shell.
    why: |
      Early members create culture and activity. When they leave, they take
      that energy with them. If the next generation wasn't being cultivated,
      there's no one to carry the torch. Communities need succession.

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Company has active Discord. Users start asking product questions there
      instead of using in-app support. Feature requests flood Discord instead
      of feedback tools. Bug reports in threads get lost. Now community is
      both the product AND support, but built for neither.
    why: |
      When community is easier to access than product, users go there first.
      This fragments feedback, creates duplicate work, and makes community
      overwhelming. The community isn't designed to be a support system.

      Community has 5,000 members. 50 are active. "But 5,000 people are
      watching!" Decision made based on active voices. Silent majority
      assumed to agree. Later discovered: silent majority had left long
      ago. The 5,000 was a vanity number of abandoned accounts.
    why: |
      Lurkers aren't necessarily engaged. Many joined and forgot. Many
      muted the server. The assumption that silence equals agreement or
      attention is dangerous. Only measured engagement is real engagement.

      Toxicity creeps in. Community degrades before anyone notices.
