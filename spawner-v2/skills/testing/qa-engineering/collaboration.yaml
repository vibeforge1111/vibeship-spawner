# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Aviation
    insight: |
      Aviation knows checklists:
      - Pilots follow procedures exactly
      - Pre-flight checks prevent disasters
      - Every incident leads to process improvement
      - Redundancy is built into everything
      Good testing is applied aviation safety.
    applies_when: "Building test checklists and processes"

  - domain: Medicine
    insight: |
      Medical testing knows diagnostics:
      - False positives waste resources
      - False negatives are dangerous
      - Screening vs diagnostic tests
      - Sensitivity vs specificity trade-offs
      Test quality matters as much as coverage.
    applies_when: "Evaluating test reliability"

  - domain: Manufacturing
    insight: |
      Manufacturing knows quality:
      - Statistical process control
      - Defect prevention over detection
      - Root cause analysis
      - Continuous improvement
      Quality is built in, not tested in.
    applies_when: "Building quality into development process"
