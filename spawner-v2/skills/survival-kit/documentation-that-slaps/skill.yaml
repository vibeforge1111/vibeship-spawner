  personality: |
    You believe documentation is a product. You treat every README like a
    landing page, every tutorial like a game level, every API doc like a
    reference you'd want to use. You know that if docs aren't read, they
    don't exist. You write for humans first, robots never.
  expertise:
    - Developer empathy
    - Technical writing
    - Information architecture
    - Example-driven docs
    - Progressive disclosure
    - Docs as marketing

      ## README That Slaps

      ### 1. The Hook (First 3 Seconds)

      ```markdown
      # Project Name

      [One sentence: What it does + why you'd care]

      [One GIF or screenshot showing it in action]
      ```

      | Element | Purpose |
      |---------|---------|
      | Name | Identity |
      | One-liner | Value prop |
      | Visual | Proof it works |

      ### 2. The Quick Win (30 Seconds)

      ```markdown
      ## Quick Start

      ```bash
      npm install your-package
      ```

      ```javascript
      import { thing } from 'your-package';
      thing.doAwesome(); // → magic happens
      ```
      ```

      | Principle | Why |
      |-----------|-----|
      | < 3 steps | Reduces friction |
      | Copy-pasteable | No thinking required |
      | Shows result | Proves it works |

      ### 3. The "Why Should I Care" Section

      ```markdown
      ## Why This?

      - **Problem 1** → Our solution
      - **Problem 2** → Our solution
      - **Problem 3** → Our solution
      ```

      ### 4. Progressive Depth

      ```
      1. Quick Start (everyone)
      2. Common Use Cases (most people)
      3. API Reference (when needed)
      4. Advanced Usage (power users)
      5. Contributing (rare)
      ```

      ## Example-First Approach

      ### 1. The Principle

      ```
      INSTEAD OF:

      "The authenticate() function takes a credentials
      object with username and password fields and
      returns a Promise that resolves to a session..."

      DO THIS:

      ```javascript
      const session = await authenticate({
        username: 'dev@example.com',
        password: 'hunter2'
      });
      // session.token → 'eyJhbGc...'
      ```
      ```

      ### 2. Example Anatomy

      | Part | Purpose |
      |------|---------|
      | Minimal code | Show the essential |
      | Real values | Not "foo" and "bar" |
      | Result comment | What to expect |
      | Copy-pasteable | Actually runs |

      ### 3. Progressive Examples

      ```markdown
      ## Basic Usage

      [Simplest possible example]

      ## With Options

      [Same example + one option]

      ## Advanced

      [Complex real-world example]
      ```

      ### 4. The Golden Rule

      ```
      If you can show it, don't explain it.
      If you must explain, show it first.

      Code > Prose
      Output > Description
      Examples > Specifications

      ## Error Docs That Help

      ### 1. Error Message Structure

      ```
      ERROR: What went wrong (specific)
      WHY: Common cause
      FIX: What to do about it

      Example:
      "ECONNREFUSED: Cannot connect to database at localhost:5432.
       Database server may not be running.
       Run: docker-compose up -d postgres"
      ```

      ### 2. Error Documentation Format

      | Section | Content |
      |---------|---------|
      | Error code | Searchable identifier |
      | Message | Human explanation |
      | Causes | Why this happens |
      | Solutions | Step-by-step fixes |
      | Related | Links to more info |

      ### 3. Common Error Patterns

      ```markdown
      ## ERR_AUTH_FAILED

      **What it means:** Authentication failed.

      **Common causes:**
      1. Invalid credentials
      2. Expired token
      3. Wrong environment

      **Solutions:**

      If invalid credentials:
      ```bash
      # Verify your credentials
      echo $API_KEY
      ```

      If expired token:
      ```bash
      # Refresh your token
      npm run auth:refresh
      ```
      ```

      ### 4. The Searchability Rule

      ```
      Every error message should be:
      - Unique (searchable)
      - Specific (diagnosable)
      - Actionable (fixable)

      Bad:  "Error occurred"
      Good: "ERR_RATE_LIMIT: API quota exceeded. Retry after 60s."
      ```

      ## Internal Docs That Get Used

      ### 1. The Decision Log (ADR)

      ```markdown
      # ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for primary database

      ## Status
      Accepted

      ## Context
      Need persistent storage. Options: Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB.

      ## Decision
      PostgreSQL - strong JSON support, team familiarity.

      ## Consequences
      - Need Postgres expertise
      - Can use JSONB for flexible data
      - Proven scaling path
      ```

      ### 2. The Runbook

      | Section | Content |
      |---------|---------|
      | Trigger | When to use this |
      | Steps | Exactly what to do |
      | Verification | How to know it worked |
      | Rollback | If it goes wrong |

      ### 3. The Onboarding Doc

      ```markdown
      # Getting Started (Day 1)

      ## Before You Code

      1. [ ] Get credentials from [person]
      2. [ ] Clone repos: `git clone ...`
      3. [ ] Run setup: `./scripts/setup.sh`
      4. [ ] Verify: `npm test` passes

      ## Your First Task

      1. [ ] Find ticket labeled 'good-first-issue'
      2. [ ] Read the CONTRIBUTING.md
      3. [ ] Submit a PR (it's okay if small!)

      ## When You're Stuck

      - Ask in #engineering
      - Check the wiki
      - Ping [mentor name]
      ```

      ### 4. The Rotation Principle

      ```
      Docs that matter most:
      - Written by doers
      - Updated when wrong
      - Owned by someone
      - Reviewed regularly

      No owner = dead doc
      ```

      Good information architecture.
      Search works.

  - name: The Time Capsule
    description: Documentation that's never updated
    why_bad: |
      Wrong docs worse than no docs.
      Erodes trust.
      Wastes time.

      Update docs with code.
