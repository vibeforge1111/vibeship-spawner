# Documentation That Slaps Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: docs-rot
    summary: Documentation becomes outdated and wrong
    severity: high
    situation: Docs say one thing, code does another
    why: |
      Docs not updated with code.
      No ownership.
      No review process.
    solution: |
      ## Preventing Doc Rot

      ### The Coupling Problem

      ```
      Code changes → Docs stay same → Docs lie

      BAD:
      Docs live separately from code.
      Updating is "someone else's job."
      No one notices when they diverge.
      ```

      ### Solutions

      | Strategy | How |
      |----------|-----|
      | Docs-as-code | Docs in same repo as code |
      | PR checklist | "Did you update docs?" |
      | Doc tests | Code examples that run |
      | Ownership | Named maintainer for docs |

      ### The Freshness Check

      ```markdown
      Add to every doc:

      ---
      Last verified: 2024-01-15
      Verified by: @username
      ---

      Set calendar reminder to verify quarterly.
      Delete if no one verifies.
      ```

      ### Doc Test Pattern

      ```javascript
      // In tests/docs.test.js
      // Test every code example in README

      test('README quick start works', () => {
        // Copy-paste from README
        const result = doTheThing();
        expect(result).toBe('expected');
      });
      ```

      ### Ruthless Deletion

      | If doc is... | Action |
      |--------------|--------|
      | > 6 months unverified | Review or delete |
      | Contradicts code | Fix or delete |
      | Never accessed | Consider deleting |
      | Duplicated elsewhere | Delete one |
    symptoms:
      - "The docs are wrong"
      - "Ignore the wiki"
      - "Ask [person] instead"
      - Outdated screenshots
    detection_pattern: "docs are wrong|outdated|don't trust"

  - id: write-only-docs
    summary: Docs written but never read
    severity: medium
    situation: Lots of documentation that no one uses
    why: |
      Written for completion, not users.
      No user research.
      Wrong format or location.
    solution: |
      ## Docs People Actually Read

      ### The Usage Test

      ```
      BEFORE writing docs, ask:

      - Who will read this?
      - When will they need it?
      - How will they find it?
      - What will they do with it?

      If no clear answers → don't write it.
      ```

      ### User Research for Docs

      | Method | How |
      |--------|-----|
      | Watch onboarding | What do they search for? |
      | Support tickets | What questions repeat? |
      | Analytics | What pages get traffic? |
      | Ask directly | "Did docs help?" |

      ### Location Strategy

      | Doc Type | Location |
      |----------|----------|
      | Getting started | README (top) |
      | API reference | Near the code |
      | Troubleshooting | Error messages link to it |
      | How-to guides | Search-optimized titles |

      ### The Right Format

      ```
      DECISION MAKING:
      → Short doc with bullet points

      LEARNING:
      → Tutorial with examples

      REFERENCE:
      → Searchable, structured, complete

      TROUBLESHOOTING:
      → Error code indexed, solutions first
      ```

      ### Kill Metrics

      | Signal | Action |
      |--------|--------|
      | Zero visits | Delete or move |
      | High bounce | Improve content |
      | Long time | Too complex |
      | Support still asked | Missing info |
    symptoms:
      - Thousands of pages, low traffic
      - Same questions in Slack
      - "Did you check the docs?" / "Where?"
      - Beautiful docs no one sees
    detection_pattern: "where is|can't find|is there docs"

  - id: over-documentation
    summary: Documentation becomes maintenance burden
    severity: medium
    situation: So much docs that keeping them current is impossible
    why: |
      "Document everything" culture.
      No prioritization.
      Docs debt compounds.
    solution: |
      ## Right-Sized Documentation

      ### The Minimum Viable Doc

      ```
      MUST HAVE:
      - README with quick start
      - How to contribute
      - Where to get help

      NICE TO HAVE:
      - Tutorials
      - Architecture overview
      - ADRs

      PROBABLY DON'T NEED:
      - Documenting obvious code
      - Redundant with type system
      - Internal implementation details
      ```

      ### The Cost-Benefit Check

      | Question | If no clear answer... |
      |----------|----------------------|
      | Who needs this? | Don't write it |
      | How often used? | Consider deleting |
      | Who maintains it? | Don't write it |

      ### Docs Budget

      ```
      Treat docs like features:

      - Time to write = investment
      - Time to maintain = ongoing cost
      - Outdated docs = negative value

      Budget accordingly.
      ```

      ### The Link-Don't-Write Rule

      | Instead of... | Do this |
      |---------------|---------|
      | Copying content | Link to source |
      | Explaining library | Link to their docs |
      | Repeating info | Single source of truth |
    symptoms:
      - "Too much to maintain"
      - Duplicated information
      - Wiki sprawl
      - Outdated everywhere
    detection_pattern: "too many|where is the|which is right"

  - id: expertise-curse
    summary: Docs assume reader knows too much
    severity: medium
    situation: Experts write docs beginners can't understand
    why: |
      Writer forgot being a beginner.
      Assumed knowledge not stated.
      Jargon everywhere.
    solution: |
      ## Writing for Fresh Eyes

      ### The Beginner Test

      ```
      For every doc, ask:

      "Would I understand this on day 1?"

      If not, you're missing:
      - Context
      - Prerequisites
      - Definitions
      - Links to learn more
      ```

      ### Assumed Knowledge Box

      ```markdown
      ## Prerequisites

      Before starting, you should know:
      - Basic JavaScript (functions, objects)
      - npm/yarn package management
      - Command line basics

      New to these? Start with [link].
      ```

      ### Jargon Handling

      | Strategy | Example |
      |----------|---------|
      | Define on first use | "The ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) handles..." |
      | Link to glossary | "Configure the [webhook](#glossary-webhook)" |
      | Avoid if possible | "The database connector" vs "The ORM" |

      ### Fresh Eyes Review

      ```
      BEFORE publishing:

      1. Have a new team member read it
      2. Watch them try to follow it
      3. Note where they get stuck
      4. Fix those parts

      If no new person available:
      Wait a week, read it yourself.
      ```

      ### Progressive Disclosure

      | Level | Content |
      |-------|---------|
      | 1. Quick Start | Minimum to get going |
      | 2. Basic Usage | Common scenarios |
      | 3. Deep Dive | Explain the why |
      | 4. Advanced | Edge cases, internals |
    symptoms:
      - "I don't understand this"
      - Questions about basics
      - High bounce rate on docs
      - "What does X mean?"
    detection_pattern: "what is|don't understand|confused"
