# Tech Debt Negotiation Sharp Edges

  - id: boy-who-cried-debt
    summary: Losing credibility by over-claiming
    severity: high
    situation: Team cried "tech debt" too many times
    why: |
      Every problem labeled "tech debt."
      No prioritization.
      Business stopped listening.
    solution: |
      ## Rebuilding Debt Credibility

      ### The Credibility Problem

      ```
      WHAT HAPPENED:
      - Everything was "critical debt"
      - Predictions didn't match reality
      - Fixes didn't show measurable improvement
      - Business learned to ignore

      RESULT:
      Now when debt IS critical, no one believes you.
      ```

      ### Rebuilding Trust

      | Strategy | How |
      |----------|-----|
      | Be selective | Only flag truly impactful debt |
      | Make predictions | "This will cause X by Y date" |
      | Track accuracy | Show when you were right |
      | Show ROI | Measure before/after fixes |

      ### The Proof Pattern

      ```
      Before asking for debt time:

      1. Pick ONE high-impact item
      2. Predict specific improvement
      3. Fix it
      4. Measure the improvement
      5. Show the numbers

      Now you have evidence for future asks.
      ```

      ### Severity Discipline

      | Label | Criteria |
      |-------|----------|
      | Critical | Incidents, blocking work |
      | High | Weekly pain, velocity impact |
      | Medium | Monthly friction |
      | Low | Annoyance, code smell |

      ```
      BE HONEST about severity.
      Overstating destroys trust.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Engineering always says that"
      - Debt requests ignored
      - Eye-rolls at tech debt mention
      - Business skepticism
    detection_pattern: "you always say|not again|can it wait"

  - id: wrong-battle
    summary: Fixing debt that doesn't matter
    severity: medium
    situation: Spending time on low-impact improvements
    why: |
      Engineers fix what annoys THEM.
      Not what impacts BUSINESS.
      Time wasted, no credit earned.
    solution: |
      ## Impact-Based Prioritization

      ### The Impact Matrix

      ```
           HIGH BUSINESS IMPACT
                  │
        ADDRESS   │   PRIORITIZE
        (Bundle)  │   (Focus here)
      ────────────┼──────────────
        IGNORE    │   CONSIDER
        (Accept)  │   (If time permits)
                  │
           LOW BUSINESS IMPACT
        LOW ENGINEER PAIN ─── HIGH ENGINEER PAIN
      ```

      ### Business Impact Indicators

      | High Impact | Low Impact |
      |-------------|------------|
      | Causes incidents | Annoys engineers |
      | Blocks features | Slows development |
      | Customer-visible | Internal only |
      | Scales poorly | Works fine |

      ### The Question Test

      ```
      For each debt item, ask:

      "If we never fix this, what happens?"

      Nothing much → Low priority
      Velocity drops → Medium priority
      Incidents/outages → High priority
      Can't ship features → Critical
      ```

      ### Stakeholder Validation

      | Before fixing debt | Check |
      |-------------------|-------|
      | Does PM care? | Ask directly |
      | Will users notice? | Probably not |
      | Will velocity improve? | Measurably? |
      | Will incidents drop? | Trackable? |
    symptoms:
      - Refactoring for "cleanliness"
      - "It bothers me" motivation
      - No measurable improvement
      - Time spent, nothing to show
    detection_pattern: "code smell|bothers me|should be cleaner"

  - id: maintenance-burnout
    summary: Debt work becomes thankless grind
    severity: medium
    situation: Engineers hate maintenance work
    why: |
      No recognition.
      Feels like janitorial work.
      No visible progress.
    solution: |
      ## Making Debt Work Rewarding

      ### Recognition Structures

      | Method | How |
      |--------|-----|
      | Debt champions | Rotate responsibility |
      | Visible metrics | Track and celebrate |
      | Mixed sprints | Never pure debt work |
      | Team kudos | Acknowledge cleanup |

      ### The Rotation System

      ```
      DON'T: Same person always fixes debt
      DO: Rotate "debt champion" weekly

      Benefits:
      - Shared responsibility
      - Knowledge spread
      - No one person burns out
      - Everyone understands debt
      ```

      ### Bundling Strategy

      | Sprint Mix | Sustainability |
      |------------|----------------|
      | 100% debt | Burns out team |
      | 0% debt | Accumulates pain |
      | 20% debt | Sustainable |
      | Feature + cleanup | Best of both |

      ### Celebration Examples

      ```
      MAKE DEBT WORK VISIBLE:

      - "This week: 3 flaky tests fixed"
      - "Debt paydown: 15% faster deploys"
      - "Thanks for cleaning up auth module"
      - Demo debt fixes in team meetings
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Not more debt work"
      - Low morale on maintenance
      - Debt champion burnout
      - Team avoids debt tickets
    detection_pattern: "hate maintenance|boring work|no one wants"

  - id: endless-refactor
    summary: Debt fix becomes infinite project
    severity: high
    situation: "Quick cleanup" turns into months of work
    why: |
      Scope expanded.
      No clear definition of done.
      Perfect became enemy of good.
    solution: |
      ## Time-Boxing Debt Work

      ### The Iron Rules

      ```
      BEFORE STARTING:

      1. Define "done" specifically
      2. Time-box the work
      3. Write down what you WON'T fix
      4. Get agreement on scope
      ```

      ### Definition of Done Template

      ```
      DEBT FIX: [Name]

      IN SCOPE:
      - [Specific thing 1]
      - [Specific thing 2]

      OUT OF SCOPE:
      - [Thing we won't touch]
      - [Related thing to ignore]

      DONE WHEN:
      - [Measurable outcome]
      - [Pass criteria]

      TIME LIMIT: [X days/weeks]
      ```

      ### Scope Creep Defense

      | Temptation | Response |
      |------------|----------|
      | "While we're here..." | Create separate ticket |
      | "This is related..." | Out of scope |
      | "Quick fix for..." | Future debt item |
      | "We should also..." | Different project |

      ### Progress Checkpoints

      | At | Ask |
      |----|-----|
      | 25% time | On track? |
      | 50% time | Still in scope? |
      | 75% time | Will we finish? |
      | 100% time | Done or timebox extend (rare) |
    symptoms:
      - "Just a bit more"
      - Weeks become months
      - Scope kept growing
      - Never quite "done"
    detection_pattern: "almost done|bit more|while we're here"
