      ## Addressing Toxic Review Behavior

      ### Warning Signs

      | Behavior | Impact |
      |----------|--------|
      | "Obviously wrong" | Shames author |
      | Public corrections | Humiliates |
      | Personal attacks | Destroys trust |
      | Blocking without reason | Power play |
      | Never approves | Gatekeeping |

      ### If You're the Reviewer

      ```
      ASK YOURSELF:

      - Would I say this in person?
      - Am I helping or judging?
      - Is this about the code or the person?
      - Would I want this comment on my PR?
      ```

      ### If You're the Author

      | Situation | Response |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Harsh comment | "Can you help me understand what you'd suggest?" |
      | Personal attack | "Let's focus on the code" |
      | Pattern behavior | Talk to manager privately |
      | Blocking unfairly | Escalate to tech lead |

      ### If You're a Manager

      ```
      INTERVENTION STEPS:

      1. Review the review history
      2. Private conversation
      3. Specific examples
      4. Clear expectations
      5. Follow up on changes
      ```

      ### Team-Level Fixes

      | Fix | How |
      |-----|-----|
      | Review training | Teach empathetic feedback |
      | Comment templates | Provide good examples |
      | Anonymized reviews | Where appropriate |
      | Feedback on feedback | Review the reviews |
    symptoms:
      - People avoid asking for reviews
      - PRs sit waiting
      - Low morale after reviews
      - Fear of opening PRs
    detection_pattern: "harsh|brutal|afraid to|don't want to"

  - id: review-avoidance
    summary: Team avoiding code review entirely
    severity: high
    situation: Reviews seen as obstacle, not value
    why: |
      Reviews too slow.
      Process too painful.
      Value not understood.
    solution: |
      ## Reviving Review Culture

      ### Diagnosis

      | Symptom | Root Cause |
      |---------|------------|
      | PRs merged unreviewed | Pressure > process |
      | Minimal comments | Nobody cares |
      | Days to review | No SLA, not prioritized |
      | Rubber stamps | Going through motions |

      ### Quick Wins

      ```
      1. REVIEW SLA
         "All PRs get first look in 4 hours"

      2. SMALLER PRs
         "Max 400 lines changed"

      3. PR ROULETTE
         Automate reviewer assignment

      4. REVIEW TIME
         Block calendar for reviews
      ```

      ### Making Review Valuable

      | Show Value By | How |
      |---------------|-----|
      | Catching bugs | Track bugs caught in review |
      | Teaching | Juniors learn from feedback |
      | Sharing knowledge | Spread context |
      | Improving quality | Metric improvements |

      ### Culture Shift

      ```
      OLD MINDSET:
      "Review is a gate to pass"

      NEW MINDSET:
      "Review is where we learn together"

      REINFORCE BY:
      - Praising good reviews
      - Celebrating catches
      - Rotating reviewers
      - Making it fast
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Self-merging
      - "Can you just approve"
      - Reviews seen as waste
      - LGTM without looking
    detection_pattern: "just merge|skip review|takes too long"

  - id: bikeshedding
    summary: Spending review time on trivial issues
    severity: medium
    situation: Big issues ignored while style debated
    why: |
      Easy to have opinions on style.
      Hard to catch real bugs.
      No priority guidance.
    solution: |
      ## Focusing Review on What Matters

      ### The Bikeshed Problem

      ```
      WHAT HAPPENS:
      20 comments on variable names
      0 comments on the race condition

      WHY:
      - Style is easy to see
      - Bugs are hard to find
      - Opinions on style are cheap
      ```

      ### Review Priority Ladder

      | Priority | Focus Area |
      |----------|------------|
      | 1. Critical | Security, data loss, crashes |
      | 2. Important | Logic errors, edge cases |
      | 3. Moderate | Performance, maintainability |
      | 4. Minor | Style, naming, formatting |

      ### Process Fixes

      | Problem | Solution |
      |---------|----------|
      | Style debates | Auto-formatter (Prettier, etc.) |
      | Naming debates | Conventions doc |
      | Trivial comments | Use [nit] prefix |
      | Missing priorities | Review checklist |

      ### The Checklist Approach

      ```markdown
      ## Review Checklist

      Before commenting on style, verify:

      - [ ] No security issues
      - [ ] No data corruption risk
      - [ ] Error handling exists
      - [ ] Tests cover new code
      - [ ] No obvious bugs

      THEN worry about naming.
      ```

      ### Comment Quota

      ```
      RULE OF THUMB:

      For every [nit], require yourself to:
      - Look for one actual bug
      - Or leave one genuine praise

      Keeps focus on what matters.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - 50 comments, all style
      - Production bugs post-merge
      - Reviews take forever on trivial
      - Author frustration
    detection_pattern: "should rename|formatting|style|whitespace"

  - id: knowledge-gatekeeping
    summary: Using reviews to assert dominance
    severity: high
    situation: Senior devs weaponizing review
    why: |
      Ego protection.
      Power dynamics.
      Fear of being replaced.
    solution: |
      ## Inclusive Review Culture

      ### Gatekeeping Signs

      | Behavior | Translation |
      |----------|-------------|
      | "You should know this" | Making you feel small |
      | "Just do it my way" | Refusing to explain |
      | Always finding issues | Perfectionism as control |
      | Rejecting new patterns | Resisting change |

      ### Healthy Senior Behavior

      ```
      INSTEAD OF:             DO:
      "Wrong"                 "Have you considered X?"
      "Always do it this way" "We typically do X because Y"
      "Should know this"      "Here's a good resource"
      Blocking                Explaining, teaching
      ```

      ### For Authors

      | When facing... | Try |
      |----------------|-----|
      | No explanation | "Can you help me understand why?" |
      | "Just do it" | "I'd like to learn the reasoning" |
      | Consistent blocks | Document and escalate |

      ### For Teams

      | Fix | How |
      |-----|-----|
      | Rotate reviewers | No single gatekeeper |
      | Junior reviewers | Everyone's feedback valued |
      | Written standards | Not in one person's head |
      | Anonymous feedback | On review quality |
    symptoms:
      - One person always blocks
      - Fear of certain reviewers
      - Knowledge hoarding
      - "Only X understands this"
    detection_pattern: "only I|you should know|just do it|always block"
