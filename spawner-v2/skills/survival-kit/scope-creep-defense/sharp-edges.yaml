# Scope Creep Defense Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: death-by-additions
    summary: Project dies from accumulated small additions
    severity: high
    situation: Endless "tiny" requests kill the project
    why: |
      Each addition seems small.
      Nobody tracks total impact.
      Deadline stays fixed.
    solution: |
      ## Death by a Thousand Additions

      ### The Accumulation Problem

      ```
      Day 1: "This is a 2-week project"

      Week 1: "Just add login" (+3 days)
      Week 2: "Also need export" (+2 days)
      Week 3: "One more field" (+1 day)
      Week 4: "Small UI tweak" (+1 day)
      Week 5: "Quick integration" (+3 days)

      Reality: 2-week project → 5 weeks
      ```

      ### Tracking Total Impact

      | Metric | Track |
      |--------|-------|
      | Original scope | Days estimated |
      | Additions | Running total of +days |
      | Current scope | Original + additions |
      | Deadline delta | Current scope - original |

      ### Making Additions Visible

      ```
      FOR EVERY REQUEST:

      "This adds [X days] to our timeline.
       We're now at [Y days] total additions.
       Original deadline is now [Z] behind.

       Do we adjust deadline or cut something?"
      ```

      ### The Addition Budget

      | Rule | Why |
      |------|-----|
      | 10% buffer | For legitimate additions |
      | Trade-off required | No free additions |
      | Weekly audit | Surface total impact |
      | Deadline sacred | Or explicitly moved |
    symptoms:
      - Deadline slipping repeatedly
      - "Just one more" pattern
      - Team overtime
      - Quality suffering
    detection_pattern: "just add|quick addition|while you're there|one more"

  - id: stakeholder-hijack
    summary: Powerful stakeholder derails project
    severity: high
    situation: Executive request overrides everything
    why: |
      Hard to say no to power.
      "Urgent" trumps "important."
      Political dynamics.
    solution: |
      ## Handling Executive Requests

      ### The Reality

      ```
      When an executive says "add X":

      - They may not know the trade-offs
      - They often think it's simpler than it is
      - They may forget they asked
      - But ignoring them is risky
      ```

      ### The Response Framework

      | Step | Action |
      |------|--------|
      | 1. Acknowledge | "I understand this is important to you" |
      | 2. Clarify | "Let me make sure I understand what you need" |
      | 3. Impact | "Here's what this would mean for [project]" |
      | 4. Options | "We could A, B, or C" |
      | 5. Document | "Let me send you a summary for approval" |

      ### Making Trade-offs Visible

      ```
      EMAIL TEMPLATE:

      Subject: [Request] - Impact Assessment

      You requested: [X]

      Impact on current project:
      - Timeline: +[Y] weeks
      - What gets delayed: [Z]

      Options:
      A. Add it, delay launch by [Y] weeks
      B. Add it, cut [other feature]
      C. Add it to v2

      Please confirm your preference.
      ```

      ### The Paper Trail

      | Always | Why |
      |--------|-----|
      | Email confirmation | Proof of request |
      | Impact documented | No surprise later |
      | Decision recorded | Accountability |
      | Shared with team | Transparency |
    symptoms:
      - Surprise requirements
      - "CEO said so"
      - No documentation
      - Team confused
    detection_pattern: "exec wants|urgent request|priority change|from leadership"

  - id: requirements-churn
    summary: Requirements change faster than development
    severity: high
    situation: Can't finish anything because specs keep changing
    why: |
      No decision finality.
      Customer or stakeholder uncertainty.
      Fear of commitment.

      ## Stopping Requirements Churn

      ### Freeze Windows

      ```
      DEFINE FREEZE PERIODS:

      ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
      │ Sprint 1 │ FREEZE │ Sprint 2 │ FREEZE  │
      └──────────┴────────┴──────────┴─────────┘
            ↑                    ↑
         Changes          Changes
         collected        collected
         for Sprint 2     for Sprint 3
      ```

      ### The Commitment Point

      | Stage | Flexibility |
      |-------|-------------|
      | Discovery | High - explore options |
      | Design | Medium - refine approach |
      | Development | Low - only critical |
      | Testing | Minimal - bugs only |
      | Release | None - frozen |

      ### Churn Cost Visibility

      ```
      When requirements change mid-sprint:

      "This change will:
       - Throw away [X hours] of work
       - Add [Y hours] of rework
       - Risk [Z] quality issues

       If we wait for next sprint:
       - No work thrown away
       - Full planning time
       - Higher quality result"
      ```

      ### Root Cause Address

      | Symptom | Real Problem | Fix |
      |---------|--------------|-----|
      | "We didn't think of X" | Incomplete discovery | Better upfront work |
      | "Customer changed mind" | No commitment | Get sign-off |
      | "We learned something" | Valid learning | Plan for it |
      | "Exec wants change" | Political | See stakeholder pattern |
    symptoms:
      - Rework every sprint
      - Never finishing features
      - Team frustration
      - Specs always changing
    detection_pattern: "requirements changed|new direction|actually|pivot"

  - id: gold-plating
    summary: Team adds unrequested features
    severity: medium
    situation: Developers building more than asked
    why: |
      Perfectionism.
      "While I'm in there."
      Interesting > important.
    solution: |
      ## Preventing Gold Plating

      ### What It Looks Like

      ```
      ASKED FOR:
      - Login button

      DELIVERED:
      - Login button
      - Remember me checkbox
      - Social login options
      - Password strength meter
      - Forgot password flow
      - Two-factor auth

      "But it's better this way!"
      (Also: 3 weeks late)
      ```

      ### Definition of Done

      | Instead of | Use |
      |------------|-----|
      | "Done when good" | Checklist of requirements |
      | "Complete" | Specific acceptance criteria |
      | "Finished" | Story points/scope document |

      ### The Question Test

      ```
      Before adding anything:

      "Is this in the requirements?"

      NO → Create new ticket
           Do not add
           Stay focused
      ```

      ### Culture Shift

      | Old Mindset | New Mindset |
      |-------------|-------------|
      | More is better | Focused is better |
      | Anticipate needs | Respond to needs |
      | Complete solution | Minimum viable |
      | Perfect | Shippable |
    symptoms:
      - Features nobody asked for
      - Taking longer than estimated
      - Scope creep from within
      - "I added a few things"
    detection_pattern: "while I was there|also added|thought it would be nice|bonus"
