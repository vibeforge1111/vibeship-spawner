      - "Character backstories and motivations"
      - "Environmental lore and history"
      - "Story beats for color scripting"
      - "Symbolic requirements (faction colors, motifs)"
    expects: |
      Narrative context that informs visual design:

# Defines how this skill provides work to others
provides_context_to:
  - skill: 3d-modeling
    provides:
      - "Orthographic views (front, side, back, top)"
      - "Material callout sheets with surface properties"
      - "Scale reference with measurements"
      - "Color palette with hex values"
      - "Detail breakouts for complex areas"
      - "Functional notes (moving parts, attachments)"
    handoff_checklist:
      - "All orthographic views complete and aligned"
      - "Materials labeled with clear terminology"
      - "Scale reference using standard units"
      - "Complex areas have detail callouts"
      - "PSD/AI source files available if needed"
      - "Verbal handoff meeting scheduled"
    notes: |
      3D artists need CLARITY over beauty. A clear orthographic
      beats a beautiful painting they can't interpret. Always ask:
      "Could someone build this without asking me questions?"

  - skill: environment-art
    provides:
      - "Hero keyframes establishing lighting and mood"
      - "Prop callout sheets with scale and materials"
      - "Material palette for the environment"
      - "Modular kit suggestions"
      - "Top-down layouts for interiors"
      - "Lighting direction and time-of-day notes"
    handoff_checklist:
      - "Scale reference in all environment shots"
      - "Recurring elements identified for modularity"
      - "Lighting consistent with game's light rig"
      - "Props broken out individually"
      - "Floor plan matches playable space requirements"
    notes: |
      Environment artists build in modules. Identify what repeats
      and what's unique. Flag hero moments vs. fill areas.
      Consider player navigation and sightlines.

  - skill: character-design
    provides:
      - "Character turnaround sheets"
      - "Expression sheets for emotional range"
      - "Costume/armor breakdowns"
      - "Color variations for customization"
      - "Silhouette comparison with other characters"
      - "Accessory details"
    handoff_checklist:
      - "Turnaround views aligned and consistent"
      - "Proportions clear and measurable"
      - "Layering of costume elements documented"
      - "Hair and cloth physics areas noted"
      - "Facial topology landmarks indicated"
    notes: |
      Character concepts must consider animation.
      Flag areas that will deform. Note where costume
      might clip. Design joints to work in motion.

  - skill: technical-animation
    provides:
      - "Joint placement suggestions"
      - "Range of motion sketches"
      - "Costume physics notes"
      - "Deformation-friendly design callouts"
      - "Accessory attachment points"
    handoff_checklist:
      - "Joints positioned at natural pivot points"
      - "Extreme poses sketched to test design"
      - "Cloth/hair simulation areas marked"
      - "Hard/soft surface boundaries clear"
      - "No designs that prevent basic movement"
    notes: |
      Work backwards from motion. If a character needs to
      crouch, design costume that allows it. If armor needs
      to move, show how plates slide.

  - skill: vfx-art
    provides:
      - "Emission/glow areas and colors"
      - "Magic/energy effect style frames"
      - "Particle system concepts"
      - "Environmental effects (weather, atmosphere)"
      - "Destruction/damage state progressions"
    handoff_checklist:
      - "Emission colors specified with intensity"
      - "Effect timing/behavior described"
      - "Integration points on characters/props marked"
      - "Performance tier considered"
    notes: |
      VFX concepts often need animation. Provide keyframes
      showing effect evolution over time. Consider how
      effects read against various backgrounds.

  - skill: ui-design
    provides:
      - "UI style frames matching game aesthetic"
      - "Icon design language"

      - "Color contrast meets accessibility standards"
      - "Responsive behavior noted for different screens"
    notes: |
      UI lives ON TOP of your game art. Design both together.
      UI colors must read against all possible backgrounds.
      Consider visibility during intense gameplay.

  - skill: marketing-art

      - "High-resolution hero images"
      - "Composition variations for different aspect ratios"
      - "Layered files for compositing"

      - "Multiple crops available (16:9, 1:1, 9:16)"
      - "Character/logo integration points identified"
      - "Legal-approved for marketing use"
    notes: |
      Marketing needs flexibility. Provide layers, crops,
      and variations. Design with text overlay zones.
      Consider where logos and ratings will go.

  - skill: audio-design
    provides:
      - "Material descriptions for sound design"
      - "Environment ambiance notes"
      - "Character personality for voice direction"
      - "Scale reference for sound perspective"
    handoff_checklist:
      - "Materials described with sound-relevant properties"
      - "Environment acoustic qualities noted"
      - "Size/weight indicated for impact sounds"
    notes: |
      Audio and visuals must match. A metal surface that
      looks heavy but sounds light breaks immersion.
      Include material notes in concepts.

# How this skill collaborates laterally (peer-to-peer)
peer_collaboration:
  - skill: lighting-art
    relationship: "Bidirectional"
    gives: "Lighting intent, mood reference, color scripts"
    receives: "In-engine lighting feedback, technical constraints"
    sync_points:
      - "After keyframe approval, before environment production"
      - "During color script development"
      - "When concept lighting doesn't match engine capability"
    notes: |
      Painted lighting is aspirational. Work with lighting artists
      to understand what's achievable in-engine. Adjust concepts
      if the gap is too large.

  - skill: level-design
    relationship: "Bidirectional"
    gives: "Environment concepts, landmark identification"
    receives: "Gameplay requirements, player pathing needs"
    sync_points:
      - "Before environment concepting begins"
      - "After major gameplay changes"
      - "When concepts affect navigation"
    notes: |
      Level designers need navigation clarity, concept artists
      need visual interest. Find balance. Landmarks should be
      both navigational AND visually compelling.

  - skill: production-management
    relationship: "Receives from, reports to"
    gives: "Time estimates, asset lists, blocker flags"
    receives: "Priorities, deadlines, scope changes"
    sync_points:
      - "Sprint planning"
      - "When scope changes affect concepts"
      - "When concepts reveal scope creep"
    notes: |
      Flag early if concepts reveal more work than expected.
      A "simple" environment that needs 200 props is scope creep.
      Communicate proactively.
