# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Film Production
    insight: |
      Film sets have defined roles and pipelines:
      - Director (Game Designer) sets vision
      - DP (Technical Artist) executes visuals
      - Editor (Developer) assembles pieces
      - Sound Designer (Audio) adds depth

      Unreal's Sequencer is literally film tools.
      Virtual production uses Unreal for actual films.
    applies_when: "Creating cinematics, cutscenes, or virtual production"

  - domain: Architecture
    insight: |
      Architects know about:
      - Level of Detail (LOD) for presentation
      - Spatial relationships and flow
      - Materials and lighting
      - Scale and proportion

      Level design is digital architecture.
      Use architectural principles for believable spaces.
    applies_when: "Designing levels, environments, or architectural visualization"

  - domain: Automotive
    insight: |
      Car manufacturers use Unreal for:
      - Design visualization
      - Configurators
      - Virtual showrooms

      Their techniques for:
      - Accurate materials
      - Lighting rigs
      - Camera systems
      ...apply to any product visualization.
    applies_when: "Creating product visualization or configurators"

  - domain: Simulation
    insight: |
      Simulation industries know:
      - Real-time is non-negotiable
      - Accuracy vs performance tradeoffs
      - Edge case handling
      - State machine design

      Military sims, flight sims, medical sims
      all solve problems Unreal developers face.
    applies_when: "Building training simulations or serious games"
