  - id: runaway-leader-blindspot
    summary: Failing to test for runaway leader until late in development
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You've been playtesting for months. Games feel close. Then you run a
      competitive playtest where one experienced player exploits an early
      advantage. They win by 40 points. You realize the game has been "close"
      only because your playtesters are equally matched.
    why: |
      Runaway leader problems kill games. Players recognize they've lost by round 3
      but must sit through 60+ more minutes. BGG reviews: "The game is decided too
      early." "Dead player walking for an hour." "Whoever gets lucky in round 1 wins."
      Word of mouth destroys sales. No competitive scene forms.
    solution: |
      # RUNAWAY LEADER TESTING PROTOCOL

      1. HANDICAP TESTING
         Start one player with significant advantage:
         - 25% more resources
         - Extra starting cards
         - Skip first negative event

         If they win 80%+ of games, you have a problem.

      2. SKILL DIFFERENTIAL TESTING
         Pair experienced players against beginners.
         Experienced players should win, but games should feel competitive.
         If beginners never feel they have a chance, redesign.

      3. CATCH-UP AUDIT
         For each mechanism, answer:
         - Does this help the leader more than trailing players?
         - Can losing players catch up in final rounds?
         - Is there hidden scoring that could surprise?

      4. DIMINISHING RETURNS CHECK
         First point should be easier than tenth point.
         Early game advantages should have natural caps.
    symptoms:
      - "The game was decided in round 2" comments
      - Players checking phones before game ends
      - Leading player getting bored
      - Experienced players winning 90%+ against newbies
      - Playtesters suggesting "runaway protection" rules

  - id: analysis-paralysis-trap
    summary: Decision points with too many equally valid options cause games to stall
    severity: high
    situation: |
      A player stares at the board for 5 minutes. They have 12 possible actions,
      8 cards in hand, and can see 6 other players' tableaus. They're calculating
      every permutation. The table waits. Other players check phones. The 90-minute
      game becomes 3 hours.
    why: |
      AP-prone games get played once, then shelved. "I liked it but it takes too long"
      is the death sentence. Heavier games like Food Chain Magnate solve this through
      committed strategies. Light games that cause AP are design failures.
    solution: |
      # AP PREVENTION TECHNIQUES

      1. CONSTRAIN VISIBLE OPTIONS
         - Limit hand size
         - Restrict available actions per turn
         - Use hidden information to prevent total calculation

      2. MEANINGFUL DEFAULTS
         "If you can't decide, do X" should be viable

      3. TIME PRESSURE MECHANISMS
         - Sand timers for non-critical decisions
         - Simultaneous action selection
         - Real-time phases

      4. RECOVERABLE MISTAKES
         If one bad move doesn't lose the game, decisions feel safer

      5. INFORMATION CHUNKING
         - Group related options
         - Color code by strategy
         - Reduce cross-referencing needed

      AP TEST: If a player spends 3+ minutes on a single decision in a
      <90 minute game, redesign that decision point.
    symptoms:
      - Playtest sessions running 2x expected time
      - Players apologizing for "thinking too long"
      - Analysis spreads to other players watching
      - Requests for "recommended moves" from new players

  - id: kingmaker-endgame
    summary: Losing players can determine the winner between two other players
    severity: high
    situation: |
      It's the final round. Blue is in last place with no chance of winning.
      Red and Yellow are tied. Blue's action will determine who wins.
      Blue attacks Yellow because Yellow attacked them earlier. Red wins.
      Yellow is furious - they "should have won."
    why: |
      The winner isn't determined by who played best, but by third-party
      vengeance. Games feel unfair. "Skill doesn't matter" reputation emerges.
      Playgroups have arguments. The game doesn't get replayed.
    solution: |
      # KINGMAKER PREVENTION

      1. LIMIT NEGATIVE INTERACTION IN FINAL ROUNDS
         Last 2-3 rounds: reduce attack/steal options
         Final scoring: primarily based on personal achievement

      2. HIDDEN SCORING
         If players don't know who's winning, they can't target

      3. SIMULTANEOUS FINAL ACTIONS
         Everyone commits before revealing

      4. INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR ALL ACTIONS
         Every action should benefit the actor, not just hurt others
         "I attack you AND gain resources" vs "I just attack you"

      5. KINGMAKER AUDIT QUESTION
         "In any situation, can a player who cannot win determine who does?"
         If yes, redesign that situation.

      NOTE: Some games embrace kingmaker as negotiation (Cosmic Encounter).
      This is intentional design. Accidental kingmaker is the problem.
    symptoms:
      - Post-game arguments about fairness
      - "It wasn't my fault" from winner
      - Third-place player "ruined the game"
      - Requests to ban certain moves in endgame

  - id: unclear-iconography-syndrome
    summary: Icons that make sense to designer but confuse every new player
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You designed icons that are "intuitive" - a crossed-out coin means "can't buy."
      But every single blind playtest, someone asks "what does the X over the coin
      mean?" You explain. Next game, different player asks again.
    why: |
      Players stop playing to ask questions. Flow breaks. Rules feel complicated.
      You need a 4-page icon reference sheet. The "streamlined" iconography adds
      30 minutes to teaching. BGG reviews: "Iconography is a mess." "Bring the
      rulebook every time." "We made a player aid."
    solution: |
      # ICONOGRAPHY PRINCIPLES

      1. THE BLIND PLAYTEST RULE
         If ANY blind playtester asks about an icon, redesign it
         No explanation should be needed

      2. CONSISTENCY OVER CLEVERNESS
         Same concept = same icon everywhere
         Don't use 3 different icons for "gain a resource"

      3. TEXT BACKUP
         For critical icons, add small text labels
         "2 VP" next to victory point icon

      4. COLOR + SHAPE + SIZE
         Icons should differ in multiple dimensions
         Don't rely on color alone (accessibility!)

      5. THE 3-SECOND TEST
         New player sees icon. 3 seconds. Can they guess meaning?
         Not "figure out" - GUESS correctly

      TESTING PROTOCOL:
      1. Show icons to non-gamers without context
      2. Ask them to guess meaning
      3. If <80% correct, redesign
      4. Repeat with new icons
    symptoms:
      - Same icon question every playtest
      - Players keeping rulebook open for icons
      - Homemade player aids appearing
      - Rules explanations include "and this icon means..."

  - id: first-player-advantage-imbalance
    summary: Going first provides significant advantage with no compensation
    severity: high
    situation: |
      After 20 playtests, you notice first player wins 65% of games.
      Experienced players fight for first player seat. New players
      complain about losing just because they went last.
    why: |
      Turn order feels random but determines outcome. Skilled play matters less
      than seating. Competitive play becomes about drafting turn order.
      The game feels unfair. "I never had a chance" is the worst player experience.
    solution: |
      # TURN ORDER BALANCE APPROACHES

      1. COMPENSATION RESOURCES
         Later players get incrementally more starting resources
         Test: What amount makes win rate equal?

      2. SNAKE DRAFT ORDER
         1-2-3-4-4-3-2-1 for picking actions/resources
         Last player gets two consecutive picks

      3. DYNAMIC TURN ORDER
         Performance-based: leader goes last
         Choice-based: bid resources for position
         Role-based: first player rotates

      4. SIMULTANEOUS ACTION
         Eliminate the problem entirely
         Everyone acts at once, reveal, resolve

      5. LAST PLAYER ADVANTAGE
         Design so going last has benefits
         More information, better reaction, final say

      TESTING REQUIREMENT:
      Run 20+ games tracking first player wins
      Target: 50% ± 10% (40-60%)
      If outside range, add compensation
    symptoms:
      - First player win rate >55%
      - Experienced players preferring same seat
      - New players complaining about turn order
      - House rules emerging for compensation

  # PLAYTESTING GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: friendly-playtester-bias
    summary: Friends and family don't give honest critical feedback
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You've run 30 playtests with your game group. Everyone says it's fun.
      You take it to a convention. Strangers play. They hate it. They point
      out problems your group never mentioned. Your friends were being nice.
    why: |
      Friends don't want to hurt your feelings. They've invested in your success.
      They've adapted to broken mechanics without realizing it. They know the
      "right" way to play from your explanations. The game you've been testing
      isn't the game strangers experience.
    solution: |
      # PLAYTESTING HIERARCHY

      1. GUIDED PLAYTESTS (Friends)
         Purpose: Early mechanic testing, obvious breaks
         Limitations: Biased feedback, adapted play
         Weight: 20% of feedback

      2. SEMI-BLIND PLAYTESTS (Acquaintances)
         Purpose: Teach-ability, mid-stage balance
         Method: Teach game, leave room, observe through video
         Limitations: Still want to please you
         Weight: 30% of feedback

      3. BLIND PLAYTESTS (Strangers)
         Purpose: Rulebook testing, true experience
         Method: Give rulebook and components. Watch from distance.
         Ask no questions. Answer no questions.
         Weight: 50% of feedback

      CRITICAL RULE: Until 10+ blind playtests succeed,
      the game is not ready. Period.

      FEEDBACK EXTRACTION:
      - Record sessions, don't rely on memory
      - Watch facial expressions, not words
      - Note where players pause, reread, or look confused
      - "What was your favorite part?" (what they actually remember)
      - "What would you change?" (what bothered them)
    symptoms:
      - All feedback is positive but game isn't selling
      - "It's great!" with no specific praise
      - Friends declining to play again
      - Convention response differs from home tests

  - id: insufficient-player-count-testing
    summary: Only testing at one player count creates hidden problems
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You tested at 4 players, box says 2-5 players. 2-player variant breaks
      because the economy assumes trading. 5-player takes 4 hours because
      downtime compounds. You only discover this after launch.
    why: |
      Scaling is not automatic. Every player count is a different game.
      The BGG weight rating differs by player count. "Great at 4, broken at 2"
      reviews torpedo sales. Disappointed customers can't return opened games
      but can leave 1-star reviews.
    solution: |
      # PLAYER COUNT TESTING MATRIX

      For each player count on the box, test:
      - 10+ complete games
      - Mix of experience levels
      - Time per game
      - Downtime between turns
      - Balance (does player count favor certain positions?)

      COMMON SCALING ISSUES:

      2-PLAYER:
      - Economy collapses without trading partners
      - Area control becomes binary
      - Take-that becomes mean-spirited
      - Hidden information too easy to track

      5-6 PLAYER:
      - Downtime exceeds 5 minutes
      - Game length doubles
      - Analysis paralysis multiplies
      - Components run out

      SOLUTIONS:
      - Variant rules for edge counts (don't force bad experience)
      - "Best at X" recommendation on box
      - Scaling charts for resources/cards
      - Speed variants for high counts

      HONESTY OPTION: Don't claim player counts you can't support.
      "3-4 players" is better than "2-5 players (3-4 recommended)"
    symptoms:
      - Wildly different play times by count
      - Reviews mentioning specific counts as broken
      - House rules for certain counts
      - Playtesters avoiding certain counts

  - id: rulebook-as-afterthought
    summary: Writing the rulebook last instead of using it as a design tool
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Game is done. Time to write the rulebook. It's two weeks of torture.
      Every time you write a rule, you find an edge case. You've been house-
      ruling things without realizing. The rulebook is 24 pages. Teaching
      takes an hour.
    why: |
      The rulebook exposes design problems. Convoluted rules to explain = convoluted
      mechanics to play. If you can't write it clearly, it's not designed clearly.
      Last-minute rulebook writing leads to ambiguity, missing cases, and
      frustrated players.
    solution: |
      # RULEBOOK-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

      1. WRITE RULEBOOK DRAFT AT CONCEPT STAGE
         If you can't explain it on paper, you can't explain it at table
         Forces clarity of thought before prototyping

      2. UPDATE RULEBOOK WITH EVERY MECHANIC CHANGE
         Rulebook is living document during development
         If change is hard to document, question the change

      3. TEST THE RULEBOOK, NOT JUST THE GAME
         Blind playtests = rulebook tests
         If players misunderstand, rulebook failed

      4. RULEBOOK TIMELINE:
         Concept: Draft rules (1 week)
         Prototype: Expand rules (ongoing)
         Alpha: Complete draft (1 month)
         Beta: Editing passes (2 months)
         Print: Final proof (1 month)
         Total: 4-6 months, not 2 weeks

      STRUCTURE TEMPLATE:
      1. Game overview (what is this about?)
      2. Components list with images
      3. Setup (visual diagram mandatory)
      4. Turn overview (simple version)
      5. Detailed actions
      6. End game and scoring
      7. Appendix / FAQ
    symptoms:
      - Dreading rulebook writing
      - Rules that are hard to phrase
      - "We'll figure it out" during playtests
      - Multiple interpretations of same rule

  # MANUFACTURING GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: manufacturing-quote-shock
    summary: Getting quotes without understanding component cost drivers
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You get excited about miniatures. Your first quote: $45 per unit for
      1000 copies. You can't sell at $90 MSRP. You spent 18 months designing
      a game you can't afford to produce.
    why: |
      Manufacturing is not linear. Miniatures can cost more than the rest of
      the game combined. Small box games can cost more per unit than big box
      because setup costs are fixed. Without manufacturing knowledge, you design
      games that can't exist economically.
    solution: |
      # COMPONENT COST REFERENCE (2024 prices, 3000-5000 unit run)

      CARDBOARD:
      - Game board (folding, ~18x18")     $2.50-4.00
      - Player boards (thick, 8x10")       $0.50-1.00 each
      - Tokens (punchboard sheet)         $0.30-0.50 per sheet
      - Box (standard size, insert)       $2.00-3.50

      PAPER:
      - Cards (poker size, 54/deck)       $0.80-1.20 per deck
      - Cards (mini, 54/deck)             $0.60-0.90 per deck
      - Rulebook (16 pages, saddle stitch) $0.30-0.50

      PLASTIC:
      - Meeples (standard wood/plastic)   $0.03-0.08 each
      - Custom meeples (new mold)         $0.15-0.40 each + $500-2000 mold
      - Dice (standard D6)                $0.05-0.10 each
      - Custom dice (new mold)            $0.20-0.50 each + $1000-3000 mold
      - Miniatures (simple, 28mm)         $0.30-0.80 each + $3000-8000 mold
      - Miniatures (detailed, 32mm+)      $0.80-2.00 each + $5000-15000 mold

      RULES OF THUMB:
      - MSRP = 5x manufacturing cost (for retail)
      - MSRP = 3-4x manufacturing cost (Kickstarter only)
      - $30 MSRP = ~$6-7 manufacturing target
      - Each new mold adds $2000-15000 to first run

      DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
      - Can you use standard components instead of custom?
      - Can you reduce component count?
      - Can you use cards instead of boards?
      - Can you use wooden cubes instead of minis?
    symptoms:
      - Sticker shock on first quote
      - Redesigning for cost after development
      - Crowdfunding goal too high to hit
      - Cutting beloved components for budget

  - id: shipping-container-nightmare
    summary: Not accounting for international shipping logistics and costs
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You manufactured in China. Shipping quote was $3000 for a container.
      Then: port delays (2 months), COVID surcharges ($15000), container
      shortage ($8000 more), customs inspection (3 weeks), warehouse fees
      ($2000). Your "shipping" budget triples. You're delivering 6 months late.
    why: |
      Shipping is not a line item - it's a complex logistics operation. Container
      rates fluctuate wildly. Delays cascade. Customs is unpredictable. Crowdfunding
      backers get angry. Refund requests pile up. Your reputation suffers before
      you've shipped your first game.
    solution: |
      # SHIPPING REALITY CHECK

      1. QUOTE TIMING
         Get shipping quotes 1 month before manufacturing ends
         Rates change constantly - old quotes are meaningless

      2. BUFFER EVERYTHING
         Time estimate + 50% = realistic estimate
         Cost estimate + 100% = safe budget
         Yes, 100%. Post-COVID shipping proved this.

      3. FULFILLMENT PARTNERS
         Use established fulfillment centers:
         - Quartermaster Logistics (US)
         - Spiral Galaxy Games (US)
         - GamesQuest (UK)
         - Ludo Fact (Germany)
         They know the gotchas you don't.

      4. CONTAINER TYPES
         - FCL (Full Container Load): Cheaper per unit, higher minimum
         - LCL (Less than Container Load): Higher per unit, lower minimum
         Break-even: ~2000-3000 standard games

      5. INCOTERMS MATTER
         - FOB (Free On Board): You pay shipping from port
         - CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight): Factory pays to destination port
         - DDP (Delivered Duty Paid): Factory handles everything
         Get DDP quotes to compare true costs.

      6. LANDED COST CALCULATION
         Manufacturing + Shipping + Duties + Insurance + Warehousing
         Don't promise MSRP until you know landed cost.
    symptoms:
      - Shipping costs exceeding manufacturing
      - Delays pushing into next holiday season
      - Customs holds with no explanation
      - Warehouse fees accumulating

  - id: box-size-economics-trap
    summary: Designing components without understanding box size cost breakpoints
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Your game needs a 12" x 9" x 3" box. Standard size is 11.5" x 11.5" x 3".
      Your slightly different box costs 40% more to manufacture because it's
      a custom size. Shipping costs increase because fewer fit per pallet.
    why: |
      Manufacturing is optimized for standard sizes. Custom anything = premium
      pricing. Pallets fit specific box counts. Shelf presence matters for
      retail. An extra half-inch could price you out of target MSRP.
    solution: |
      # STANDARD BOX SIZES (approximate, varies by manufacturer)

      COMMON SIZES:
      - Small: 6" x 6" x 1.5" (card games)
      - Medium: 8" x 8" x 2" (light games)
      - Standard: 11.5" x 11.5" x 3" (most games)
      - Big box: 12" x 12" x 4" (premium)
      - Coffin box: 15" x 11" x 4" (deluxe editions)

      COST IMPLICATIONS:
      - Standard sizes: base cost
      - Custom sizes: +20-40% manufacturing
      - Odd depths: shipping inefficiency
      - Weight > 3 lbs: shipping cost tier jump

      DESIGN APPROACH:
      1. Decide box size FIRST
      2. Design components to FIT
      3. Not the other way around

      SHELF PRESENCE REALITY:
      - Small boxes get lost in stores
      - Big boxes get limited shelf space
      - Standard 11.5" square is the sweet spot
      - Depth affects horizontal stacking

      RETAILER REQUIREMENTS:
      - Target: UPC on specific corner
      - Barnes & Noble: ISBN required
      - Amazon: weight and dimensions exact
      - Distribution: shrinkwrap standards
    symptoms:
      - Quote higher than expected for box size
      - Components don't fit standard sizes
      - Shipping quotes unusually high
      - Retailers requesting different packaging

    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Campaign is crushing it. Backers want more. You add miniatures upgrade,

      Stretch goals are promises. Each one adds:
      - Development time (new mechanics need playtesting)
      - Manufacturing complexity (new SKUs, molds, logistics)

         Know exactly what you can add
         Get manufacturing quotes for each tier
         Calculate true cost, not hopeful estimate

      2. TYPES OF STRETCH GOALS:

         LOW RISK (baked-in upgrades):
         - Better card quality (already manufacturing)
         - Art upgrades (art done, just quality)
         - Screen printing (vs stickers)
         Cost: Built into stretch tier margin

         MEDIUM RISK (additive components):
         - Extra cards (same manufacturing process)
         - More tokens (same punchboard)
         - Player aids (already printed)
         Cost: Known, scales with quantity

         HIGH RISK (new development):
         - Solo mode (new testing required)
         - Expansions (design + test + produce)
         - Miniatures (new molds, higher shipping)
         Cost: Uncertain, schedule impact unknown

      3. THE STONEMAIER APPROACH:
         - Most stretch goals are already in the box
         - Reveal what you've already planned
         - No last-minute additions
         - Deliver on time, build trust

      4. MATH CHECK:
         Every $10 increase in production cost
         requires $30-50 additional in MSRP
         Can your backers/market bear that?
    symptoms:
      - Stretch goal list longer than planned
      - New development work appearing mid-campaign
      - Manufacturing quotes changing during campaign
      - Delivery date slipping before campaign ends

    summary: Promising delivery dates based on perfect execution
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You promise December delivery for October campaign. Manufacturing
      needs 90 days + 30 days shipping = February at earliest. But everything
      went perfectly. Manufacturer delayed 3 weeks. Customs inspection added
      2 weeks. It's now April. Backers are calling you a scammer.
    why: |
      Kickstarter backers have seen too many delays. They expect delays. But
      if YOU promised December, YOU broke the promise. Trust evaporates.
      Refund requests increase. BGG threads turn hostile. Your next campaign
      starts with a reputation problem.

      # TIMELINE REALITY

      1. BEST CASE VS REALISTIC:
         Manufacturing quote: 60-90 days
         Real manufacturing: 90-120 days (always delays)

         Shipping quote: 30-45 days
         Real shipping: 45-90 days (2020-2023 proved this)

         Fulfillment: 2-4 weeks per region
         Real fulfillment: 4-8 weeks (address errors, customs)

      2. COMMUNICATION FORMULA:
         Promised date = Realistic date + 2 months buffer
         If you think June, say August.
         Delivering early = hero
         Delivering late = villain

      3. UPDATE CADENCE:
         - Monthly updates during development
         - Weekly during manufacturing
         - Daily during shipping/fulfillment
         Silence = assumed disaster

      4. WHAT TO COMMUNICATE:
         - Where in the process (photos!)
         - What's going well
         - What's challenging
         - Revised timeline if any
         - Never hide problems

      STONEMAIER PRINCIPLE:
      "Set expectations low, then exceed them."
      Nobody complains about early delivery.
    symptoms:
      - Manufacturing running behind quote
      - Shipping delays accumulating
      - Backer comments asking for updates
      - Refund requests before delivery

    summary: Campaign hype creates expectations your game can't meet
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Campaign video was gorgeous. Photos were professional. Copy was
      compelling. Game arrives: it's fine. Not the transformative experience
      implied. Reviews mention disappointment. Word of mouth: "Overhyped."
    why: |
      Marketing creates promises. The game must deliver. Board game backers
      talk to each other. One disappointed backer = ten warned prospects.
      Your reputation precedes your next campaign. Overpromise once, struggle
      to fund twice.

      # HONEST MARKETING FRAMEWORK

      1. SHOW THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
         - Gameplay videos, not just art
         - Real prototype photos alongside renders
         - Full playthrough videos (unedited)
         - Known issues and how you're addressing them

      2. COMPARISON CALIBRATION
         "If you like [similar game], you'll enjoy [your game]"
         Position against appropriate competitors
         Don't compare card game to FFG epic

      3. REVIEWS BEFORE LAUNCH
         Send to honest reviewers who will criticize
         Use critical feedback to adjust messaging
         Pull quotes from balanced reviews, not just hype

      4. REALISTIC COMPONENT DISPLAY
         - Use prototype photos alongside renders
         - Note where final may differ
         - Show scale comparisons
         - List materials (cardboard thickness, card finish)

      5. GAMEPLAY EXPECTATIONS
         - Accurate play time (test at all player counts)
         - Accurate complexity rating
         - Who it's for AND who it's not for
         - Comparison to known games

      TRUST BUILDING:
      - Acknowledge limitations
      - Share development struggles
      - Be human, not corporate
      - Underpromise, overdeliver
    symptoms:
      - Reviews mentioning unmet expectations
      - "Not what I expected" comments
      - Comparisons to campaign promises
      - High rate of marketplace resales
