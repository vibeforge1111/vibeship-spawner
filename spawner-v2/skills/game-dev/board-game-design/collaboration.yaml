# =============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# =============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Psychology
    insight: |
      Psychologists know motivation better than game designers:
      - Variable reward schedules create engagement (slot machine effect)
      - Autonomy, mastery, and purpose drive intrinsic motivation
      - Loss aversion is 2x more powerful than gain
      - The endowment effect makes owned items feel more valuable
      - Flow state requires challenge slightly above skill level
    applies_when: "Designing reward systems, progression, and difficulty curves"

  - domain: Theater
    insight: |
      Theater directors know pacing and emotional arcs:
      - Rising action, climax, falling action structure
      - Every scene needs clear stakes
      - Character motivation must be transparent
      - Tension comes from anticipation, not surprise
      - The audience (players) must feel like participants
    applies_when: "Designing narrative flow and tension arcs"

  - domain: Economics
    insight: |
      Economists understand emergent markets:
      - Scarcity creates value
      - Information asymmetry drives negotiation
      - Externalities (what affects others) shape strategy
      - Equilibrium points emerge from player choices
      - The tragedy of the commons applies to shared resources
    applies_when: "Designing resource economies and player interaction"

  - domain: Architecture
    insight: |
      Architects know space and flow:
      - Desire paths show how people actually move
      - Form follows function
      - Negative space is as important as positive
      - Entry points set expectations
      - Scale affects perception
    applies_when: "Designing boards, player areas, and physical layout"

  - domain: Film
    insight: |
      Film editors know engagement:
      - Cuts create meaning through juxtaposition
      - Pacing varies with emotional content
      - Music guides emotional response
      - Every frame serves the story
      - Setup and payoff create satisfaction
    applies_when: "Designing turn structure and moment-to-moment engagement"
