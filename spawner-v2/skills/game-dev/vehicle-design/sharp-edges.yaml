  - id: wheel-to-body-ratio-failure
    summary: Wheels sized incorrectly for vehicle type, destroying believability
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Designer creates a sports car with wheels that are too small, or a truck with
      oversized wheels that make it look like a toy. The vehicle feels "off" but
      nobody can articulate why until they compare to real references.
    why: |
      The human brain has seen thousands of vehicles. We've internalized correct
      wheel-to-body proportions without consciously knowing the ratios. When
      proportions are wrong by even 10%, viewers feel discomfort even if they
      can't explain it. This is why racing game studios (Polyphony Digital, Turn 10)
      obsess over these ratios - they make or break believability.

      Real-world ratios:
      - Sports cars: Wheel diameter = 35-40% of body height
      - Supercars: Wheel diameter = 40-45% of body height
      - SUVs: Wheel diameter = 25-30% of body height
      - Trucks: Wheel diameter = 20-25% of body height
    solution: |
      BEFORE ANY DETAIL WORK:

      1. Gather 3-5 reference vehicles of the same archetype
      2. Measure wheel-to-body ratio in each reference
      3. Calculate average ratio for your target
      4. Apply ratio to your design BEFORE detailing
      5. Get stakeholder approval on proportions alone

      Quick validation:
      - Print design at small size (2 inches)
      - Compare to real vehicle photos at same size
      - Does your design feel correctly proportioned?

      Tools:
      - Overlay real vehicle silhouettes on your design
      - Use guide grids based on wheel diameter
      - Check in 3D software with scale reference
    symptoms:
      - "Something feels off but I can't say what"
      - Vehicle looks like a toy
      - Vehicle looks aftermarket/modified when it shouldn't
      - Racing game QA rejects the model

  - id: non-turning-wheels
    summary: Wheel arches designed without considering steering geometry
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      The 3D modeler discovers that the front wheels, when turned to full lock,
      clip through the wheel arches or leave embarrassing gaps. The designer
      never considered steering articulation in the concept.
    why: |
      Real vehicles have wheel wells designed around steering geometry. Front
      wheels typically need 35-45 degrees of steering angle. At full lock, the
      wheel moves forward/backward AND rotates, requiring specific arch shapes.
      Ignoring this creates vehicles that can't animate properly in-game.

      Steering geometry facts:
      - Inner wheel turns more than outer (Ackermann geometry)
      - Full lock on sports car: 30-35 degrees
      - Full lock on SUV/truck: 40-50 degrees
      - Wheel arc during turn: significant fore/aft travel
    solution: |
      WHEEL WELL DESIGN CHECKLIST:

      1. Define maximum steering angle for vehicle type
      2. Model wheel at full lock position (both directions)
      3. Trace the path of the outer wheel edge
      4. Design wheel arch to clear this path + 10% margin
      5. Consider suspension compression during turning

      Arch shape guidelines:
      - Front half of arch: Tighter radius, follows tire curve
      - Rear half of arch: More clearance for forward travel
      - Inner fender: Clear tire at full compression + full lock

      For concept art:
      - Show wheel at 15-20 degree turn angle
      - Indicate full lock position with dotted line
      - Note clearance requirements on callout sheet
    symptoms:
      - Wheels clip through body in animation
      - Vehicle can't make tight turns
      - Wheel wells look wrong when wheels are turned
      - Modeler has to redesign wheel arches

  - id: floating-stance
    summary: Vehicle appears to hover above ground rather than sit on it
    severity: high
    situation: |
      The rendered vehicle looks like it's floating a few inches above the ground,
      or the wheels don't appear to be carrying weight. The suspension looks wrong.
      The tires don't deform. The vehicle has no "presence" on the surface.
    why: |
      Real vehicles sag into their suspension. Tires deform under load. Springs
      compress. There's a relationship between mass and ground that designers
      often miss when drawing from imagination rather than reference. This is
      especially common in sci-fi vehicles where "hover" is assumed to mean
      "ignore ground contact."

      Weight indicators in real vehicles:
      - Tire sidewall bulge at contact patch
      - Suspension in "loaded" position, not extended
      - Brake dust on wheels (evidence of use)
      - Ground shadow relationship (close, not distant)
    solution: |
      GROUNDING CHECKLIST:

      1. TIRE DEFORMATION
         - Add 3-5% bulge at contact patch
         - Flatten bottom of tire slightly
         - Sidewall compresses visibly

      2. SUSPENSION STATE
         - Show 20-30% suspension compression at rest
         - Front and rear should be level (or intentional rake)
         - No extended/fully topped-out suspension

      3. SHADOW RELATIONSHIP
         - Shadow directly under vehicle, minimal gap
         - Wheel shadows connect to body shadow
         - No "floating shadow" separate from vehicle

      4. BRAKE DUST / WEAR
         - Evidence of use on wheels
         - Road grime on lower body
         - Tire wear patterns

      For sci-fi/hover vehicles:
      - Still show weight through posture
      - Ground effect dust/distortion
      - Consistent hover height reference
    symptoms:
      - Vehicle looks like a render, not a photograph
      - No sense of weight or mass
      - Tires look like they're painted on
      - Vehicle appears "pasted" onto background

  - id: interior-exterior-mismatch
    summary: Interior technology level or style doesn't match exterior
    severity: high
    situation: |
      A futuristic exterior design opens to reveal a 1990s-looking dashboard.
      Or a classic muscle car design has a modern touchscreen interior. The
      cognitive dissonance breaks immersion.
    why: |
      Vehicles are designed as complete packages. The interior and exterior
      communicate the same era, technology level, and brand identity. When
      these are mismatched, viewers sense the disconnect even if they don't
      consciously analyze it. In games, this becomes apparent in cockpit view.

      Interior-exterior relationships:
      - Classic exterior = analog instruments, physical controls
      - Modern exterior = screens, touch, digital
      - Military exterior = rugged, functional, simple
      - Luxury exterior = premium materials, ambient lighting
    solution: |
      CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION:

      Technology Era:
      - Match instrument technology to exterior era
      - Match material technology (glass cockpits = modern exterior)
      - Match control technology (touchscreen = contemporary)

      Brand Identity:
      - If exterior is aggressive, interior should be focused
      - If exterior is luxurious, interior should be plush
      - If exterior is utilitarian, interior should be functional

      COCKPIT DESIGN SYNC:

      1. Define the exterior's era/technology level
      2. Research real vehicles from that era/style
      3. Match instrument style to that era
      4. Match material palette to that era
      5. Match control interface complexity

      Example sync:
      Exterior: 1970s muscle car aesthetic
      Interior: Round gauges, physical knobs, vinyl/cloth
      NOT: Touchscreen, digital dash, LED ambient

  - id: implausible-sci-fi-propulsion
    summary: Spacecraft or futuristic vehicle with no visible means of propulsion or physically impossible layout
    severity: high
    situation: |
      A spacecraft design has no visible engines, or engines that face the wrong
      direction for implied movement. A hover car has no indication of how it
      maintains altitude. A mech has no visible power source for its weapons.
      The design is cool but falls apart under basic "how would this work" scrutiny.
    why: |
      Modern audiences are sophisticated. Completely arbitrary designs feel hollow.
      Even fictional vehicles benefit from internal logic. Star Wars fighters have
      visible engines. Halo's Warthog has a clear powertrain. Mass Effect's ships
      have drive cores. The technology is fictional, but the placement makes sense.

      Plausibility questions viewers ask:
      - Where do the engines push from?
      - How does it maneuver/turn?
      - Where does fuel/power come from?
      - How do crew get in/out?
      - Where do weapons fire from (and not hit the ship)?
    solution: |
      THE "EXPLAIN IT" TEST:

      For every propulsion system, answer:
      1. How does it move forward? [show it]
      2. How does it turn/maneuver? [show thrusters]
      3. How does it stop? [retrograde thrust]
      4. Where is the power source? [imply fuel/reactor]
      5. What are the exhaust/emissions? [show vents]

      PROPULSION PLACEMENT RULES:

      Main engines:
      - Thrust aligned with center of mass
      - Size proportional to implied power
      - Visible from rear view

      Maneuvering:
      - Paired thrusters for rotation
      - Placed at extremities (more leverage)
      - Visually distinct from main engines

      Power:
      - Central/protected location
      - Size proportional to vehicle capability
      - Implied cooling/venting

      Hover vehicles:
      - Downward-facing lift surfaces
      - Heat/thrust management for ground
      - Visible when viewed from below

  - id: arbitrary-panel-lines
    summary: Surface breaks and panel lines that serve no functional or visual purpose
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      A vehicle design is covered in panel lines, gaps, and surface breaks that
      don't correspond to functional elements, manufacturing breaks, or access
      panels. The "greeble" makes the design busy without adding meaning.
    why: |
      Real vehicles have panel lines for specific reasons: manufacturing assembly,
      maintenance access, functional elements, and aerodynamics. Arbitrary lines
      create visual noise and feel amateur. They also create problems for texturing
      (where are the seams?) and damage modeling (what breaks off?).

      Panel line purposes:
      - Assembly: Where parts are joined in manufacturing
      - Access: Doors, hoods, trunk, fuel filler, charging port
      - Functional: Vents, intakes, cooling, sensors
      - Styling: Character lines that define form
    solution: |
      THE "WHY IS THIS LINE HERE" TEST:

      For every panel line, answer one of:
      - "This separates manufacturing panels"
      - "This is where you access [component]"
      - "This is a functional intake/vent for [purpose]"
      - "This is a styling line that defines [form]"

      If you can't answer, delete the line.

      PANEL LINE HIERARCHY:

      Primary (visible at distance):
      - Door cuts
      - Hood/trunk openings
      - Major body breaks

      Secondary (visible at medium range):
      - Vent openings
      - Trim separation
      - Glass to body transition

      Tertiary (close inspection):
      - Seam lines
      - Small access panels
      - Trim clip locations

      Design in layers - start with primary, add secondary
      only where needed, tertiary only for realism passes.
    symptoms:
      - Design looks "busy" without being detailed
      - Can't explain what surfaces are what
      - Texturing team confused about material breaks
      - Design looks like concept art, not buildable vehicle

  - id: damage-state-afterthought
    summary: No plan for how vehicle takes damage, leading to awkward destruction
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      The vehicle design is final and approved, but when the damage modeler starts
      work, they discover there's no logical way to damage the vehicle. Panels don't
      break in sensible places. There's no interior to reveal. Damage looks arbitrary.
    why: |
      In action games, vehicles spend significant time damaged. If damage isn't
      planned from the beginning, it either looks arbitrary or requires redesigning
      the vehicle after it's "done." Smart design includes damage logic from the
      start - panel breaks, interior structure, progressive destruction path.

      Damage planning requirements:
      - Where do panels break? (defined by panel lines)
      - What's revealed when panels are gone? (structure, mechanics)
      - What's the destruction sequence? (progressive damage)
      - What survives to the end? (silhouette recognition)
    solution: |
      DAMAGE-FIRST DESIGN PROCESS:

      1. DEFINE PANEL BREAKS
         Every panel line is a potential break point
         Identify 3-5 major panels that detach
         Identify panels that deform vs. break

      2. DESIGN THE SKELETON
         What's visible when skin is removed?
         Engine/frame/structure under panels
         Ensure skeleton is designed, not blank

      3. PLAN DESTRUCTION SEQUENCE
         Level 1: Scratches, small dents
         Level 2: Panel deformation, broken lights
         Level 3: Panel separation, exposed mechanics
         Level 4: Major structural damage
         Level 5: Destroyed but recognizable

      4. PRESERVE SILHOUETTE
         Even at Level 4-5, vehicle type should be clear
         Core masses survive destruction
         Key identifying features remain

      DELIVERABLE:
      Include damage callouts in concept package
      Show at least 3 damage states in concept art
      Note which panels detach vs deform
    symptoms:
      - Damage team requests "damage concepts" after approval
      - Damaged vehicles look like unrelated debris
      - No visible internal structure when panels are gone
      - Destruction doesn't progress logically

  - id: scale-reference-absence
    summary: Vehicle designed without human scale reference, leading to sizing confusion
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      The awesome spacecraft concept is approved and built to spec, then someone
      puts a human next to it and realizes it's either comically small or
      building-sized. The design gave no indication of actual scale.
    why: |
      Without scale reference, viewers project their own assumptions. What the
      designer imagined as fighter-sized might read as bomber-sized to viewers.
      Doors, windows, and cockpits should imply human occupation and provide
      scale anchors. Real vehicle designers always include human figures.

      Scale anchor elements:
      - Door height (2m for comfortable entry)
      - Window proportions (head-sized panes)
      - Seat spacing (0.5m width per occupant)
      - Cockpit volume (human fits inside)
      - Step heights (0.3m for comfortable climbing)
    solution: |
      MANDATORY SCALE REFERENCES:

      Every vehicle concept MUST include:
      1. Human figure in at least one view
      2. Door/entry proportions defined
      3. Window/cockpit sized for occupants
      4. Dimensions noted in meters/feet

      SCALE ANCHOR CHECKLIST:

      Ground vehicles:
      [ ] Door height appropriate (1.8-2.2m)
      [ ] Seat visible through window
      [ ] Steering wheel/controls scaled to hands
      [ ] Ground clearance human-accessible

      Spacecraft:
      [ ] Cockpit sized for crew count
      [ ] Airlock/entry human-proportioned
      [ ] Window panes indicate scale
      [ ] Compared to known spacecraft

      Military:
      [ ] Crew stations visible
      [ ] Entry hatches human-sized
      [ ] Weapon scale indicates vehicle size
      [ ] Personnel shown for reference

      DELIVERABLE:
      Include human figure silhouettes at 1.8m height
      in at least side and front views.
    symptoms:
      - "How big is this supposed to be?" in reviews
      - 3D model built at wrong scale
      - Interiors don't fit humans when modeled
      - Vehicle looks like toy or building unexpectedly

  - id: symmetry-blindness
    summary: Vehicle designed perfectly symmetrical when asymmetry would add interest or function
    severity: low
    situation: |
      Every vehicle in the game's fleet is perfectly symmetrical. While real and
      intentional for some vehicles, others would benefit from functional asymmetry
      that the designer never considered. The fleet feels monotonous.
    why: |
      While many vehicles are symmetrical (cars, most aircraft), interesting
      asymmetry exists for functional reasons: single-seat offset cockpits, weapon
      mounts, exhaust routing, fuel filler locations. Intentional asymmetry can
      add character and functionality. A fleet of perfectly symmetrical vehicles
      feels artificial.

      Functional asymmetry examples:
      - Driver position (left vs right side markets)
      - Fuel filler (always on one side)
      - Exhaust routing (especially on mid-engine cars)
      - Weapon mounts (coverage angles)
      - Access panels (maintenance needs)
    solution: |
      ASYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS:

      Functional asymmetry:
      - Driver position (offset cockpits)
      - Fuel/charge ports (real location)
      - Exhaust termination (routing logic)
      - Weapon mounts (firing arcs)
      - Entry points (which side faces dock/curb)

      Visual asymmetry:
      - Slight variations in vents/intakes
      - Asymmetric graphics/livery
      - Weathering/damage variation
      - Accessory placement (antenna, sensors)

      WHEN TO USE:

      Keep symmetrical:
      - Production vehicles (manufacturing)
      - Aircraft (balance requirements)
      - Racing vehicles (regulations)

      Consider asymmetry:
      - Military (functional weapon placement)
      - Spacecraft (mission-specific loadouts)
      - Customs/modified vehicles (character)
      - Unique hero vehicles (recognition)

  - id: customization-afterthought
    summary: Base design doesn't accommodate player customization, requiring redesign
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      A racing game's vehicle is approved, then the customization team discovers
      that aftermarket parts don't fit, liveries distort on the complex surfaces,
      and there's no logical place to mount spoilers. The design must be modified.
    why: |
      In games with customization, the base design must accommodate modification.
      Panel surfaces need to be livery-friendly. Mounting points need to exist.
      Wheel wells need clearance for larger wheels. This must be designed in,
      not retrofitted, or the customization system feels limited and arbitrary.

      Customization requirements:
      - Body panel surfaces suitable for wraps/liveries
      - Defined mounting zones for aftermarket parts
      - Wheel well clearance for wheel/tire upgrades
      - Logical spoiler/wing attachment points
      - Interior visible through windows for upgrades
    solution: |
      CUSTOMIZATION-READY DESIGN:

      Body panels:
      - Large, relatively flat surfaces for liveries
      - Clear panel break definitions for part swaps
      - Consistent curvature within panels
      - Defined zones: hood, roof, doors, quarters

      Mounting zones:
      - Trunk lid: spoiler mounting area
      - Roof: scoop/intake mount zone
      - Bumpers: splitter/diffuser attachment
      - Fenders: widebody extension zones

      Wheel wells:
      - 10-15% oversized from stock wheel
      - Fender lips that can be rolled/removed
      - Inner fender clearance for camber

      DOCUMENTATION:
      Include customization zone callouts showing:
      - Livery-safe surfaces
      - Aftermarket part mounting points
      - Wheel clearance ranges
      - Interior upgrade visibility zones
    symptoms:
      - Liveries distort on complex surfaces
      - Aftermarket parts look pasted on
      - Larger wheels clip through fenders
      - Customization feels limited

  - id: form-language-inconsistency
    summary: Mixed visual vocabulary within a single vehicle or across a faction fleet
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      A vehicle has sharp, angular features on the front and soft, rounded features
      on the rear. Or a game faction's fleet has vehicles with completely different
      design languages, so they don't feel like they belong together.
    why: |
      Form language is the consistent visual vocabulary that defines identity.
      Mixing languages within a vehicle creates cognitive dissonance. Mixing
      languages within a faction creates a fleet that doesn't feel cohesive.
      Real manufacturers maintain consistency for brand recognition.

      Form language elements:
      - Edge character (sharp, soft, mixed)
      - Surface tension (creased, flowing)
      - Graphic shapes (circles, hexagons, triangles)
      - Proportion ratios (similar across models)
    solution: |
      FORM LANGUAGE DOCUMENT:

      For each faction/manufacturer, define:

      1. EDGE CHARACTER
         [ ] Sharp and angular
         [ ] Soft and rounded
         [ ] Mixed with rules (front sharp, sides soft)

      2. SURFACE TREATMENT
         [ ] High tension (sharp creases)
         [ ] Low tension (flowing surfaces)
         [ ] Specific crease angles

      3. GRAPHIC ELEMENTS
         List 3-5 signature shapes:
         - Primary: ___________
         - Secondary: ___________
         - Accent: ___________

      4. PROPORTION RULES
         - Wheel-to-body ratio: ___
         - Glasshouse ratio: ___
         - Overhang rules: ___

      VALIDATION:
      - Does new vehicle use defined shapes?
      - Does edge character match language?
      - Would it be recognized as same manufacturer?
      - Silhouette-test the fleet together
    symptoms:
      - Fleet doesn't look cohesive
      - Can't tell which faction vehicle belongs to
      - Individual vehicles feel schizophrenic
      - Brand identity not recognizable
