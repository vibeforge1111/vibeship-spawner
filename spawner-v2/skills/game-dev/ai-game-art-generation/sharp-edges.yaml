    title: Stability AI $1M Revenue License Trap
    description: >
      Free use of Stable Diffusion is only for annual revenue under $1M.
      Enterprise license required above that threshold. Many indie devs
      don't realize this until they're successful.
    detection_pattern: "stabilityai|stable.*diffusion|sdxl"
    symptoms:
      - Cease and desist letter
      - Steam store removal threat
      - Legal liability
    solution: |
      1. Document revenue projections
      2. If expecting > $1M, contact Stability AI for enterprise license
      3. Consider FLUX or other alternatives for commercial work
      4. Maintain clear documentation of all AI tool usage

    severity: high
    title: Midjourney Commercial Use Requires Paid Plan
    description: >
      Free tier Midjourney images cannot be used commercially.
      Pro/Mega required if company revenue exceeds $1M.
      All images are PUBLIC by default (competitors see your assets).
    detection_pattern: "midjourney|mj.*prompt"
    symptoms:
      - Copyright claim on game assets
      - Competitors copying revealed concepts
    solution: |
      1. Never use free tier for commercial projects
      2. Enable Stealth Mode (Pro/Mega only) for confidential work
      3. Pro plan minimum for commercial game development
      4. Document license tier used for each asset

    severity: high
    title: Steam Now Requires AI Content Disclosure
    description: >
      As of 2024, Steam requires disclosure of ALL AI-generated content.
      Failure to disclose can result in store removal. ~7% of games
      now have AI disclosures.
    detection_pattern: "steam|publish|release"
    symptoms:
      - Store page rejection
      - Post-launch takedown
      - Negative reviews from disclosure omission
    solution: |
      1. Complete AI Content section in Steam Content Survey
      2. Classify as Pre-Generated or Live-Generated
      3. Describe guardrails for live generation
      4. NEVER use Adult Only Sexual Content with live AI

    severity: high
    title: Character Consistency Drift Across Batches
    description: >
      AI models don't maintain perfect consistency. Characters drift
      in appearance, especially facial features, across separate
      generation sessions or batches.
    detection_pattern: "character|sprite|batch|multiple"
    symptoms:
      - Same character looks different in different scenes
      - Players notice "multiple twins" effect
      - Art feels inconsistent, amateur
    solution: |
      1. Train custom LoRA on character reference art
      2. Use IP-Adapter with starting_control_step: 0.5
      3. Seed lock for reproducibility
      4. Generate ALL poses/expressions in single session
      5. Manual QA pass to catch outliers
      6. Keep master reference sheet for verification
    technical_detail: >
      IP-Adapter acts as "single image fine-tuning" - maintains consistency
      better than prompt-only approaches

  - id: six-finger-anatomy-fails
    severity: medium
    title: Anatomical Failures (Six Fingers, Impossible Poses)
    description: >
      AI models frequently produce anatomically incorrect outputs:
      extra fingers, merged limbs, impossible joint angles. MIT research
      shows 90% of humans can detect these errors.
    detection_pattern: "character|human|hand|pose"
    symptoms:
      - Extra or missing fingers
      - Merged limbs
      - Impossible body proportions
      - Uncanny valley effect
    solution: |
      1. Use ControlNet with OpenPose for structured poses
      2. Generate hands separately and composite
      3. Use negative prompts: "extra fingers, deformed hands, bad anatomy"
      4. Always manually review character outputs
      5. Consider stylization that hides anatomical details
    technical_detail: >
      Hand-specific LoRAs exist on Civitai that significantly improve
      hand generation quality

  - id: pixel-art-anti-aliasing-artifacts
    severity: medium
    title: Pixel Art Anti-Aliasing Artifacts
    description: >
      Standard diffusion models produce varying pixel sizes,
      inconsistent outlines, and anti-aliasing that destroys
      pixel art aesthetic. "Nearly all pixel art models have this issue."
    detection_pattern: "pixel.*art|retro|8.*bit|sprite"
    symptoms:
      - Blurry pixels instead of crisp edges
      - Inconsistent pixel sizes in same image
      - Random noise patterns
      - Sub-pixel details that shouldn't exist
    solution: |
      1. Use Retro Diffusion or similar specialized models
      2. Post-process with color quantization
      3. Manual cleanup of edge pixels
      4. Generate at exact target resolution (e.g., 32x32)
      5. Custom downscaling algorithms, not standard bicubic

  - id: color-palette-chaos
    severity: medium
    title: Color Palette Chaos from Prompt Stacking
    description: >
      AI models interpret descriptive words statistically, not artistically.
      Stacking adjectives like "vibrant cinematic dreamy soft golden"
      creates color inconsistency as each term pulls different directions.
    detection_pattern: "vibrant|cinematic|dreamy|soft.*golden|ethereal"
    symptoms:
      - Colors don't match across assets
      - Muddy, unfocused color schemes
      - Style feels inconsistent
    solution: |
      1. Define explicit color palette before generation
      2. Use consistent, focused prompt vocabulary
      3. Train LoRA on reference palette
      4. Post-process to enforce palette compliance
      5. Use color reference image with IP-Adapter

  - id: tileable-visible-seams
    severity: medium
    title: Visible Seams in "Tileable" Textures
    description: >
      Enabling tiling option doesn't guarantee invisible seams.
      Patterns may technically tile but show obvious repetition
      when viewed in-game at scale.
    detection_pattern: "tile|seamless|texture|pattern"
    symptoms:
      - Obvious grid pattern when tiled
      - Edge artifacts at tile boundaries
      - Player notices repetition
    solution: |
      1. Use specialized tiling workflow (circular convolution)
      2. Generate 4 similar textures and use Seamless Stitcher
      3. Add variation overlays in-engine
      4. Test at game zoom levels, not just preview
      5. Use larger tile sizes to reduce repetition visibility

    severity: medium
    title: VRAM Out of Memory Crashes
    description: >
      Complex ComfyUI workflows with multiple ControlNets, IP-Adapter,
      and high resolutions can exhaust VRAM. 8GB minimum, 12GB+ recommended.
    detection_pattern: "comfyui|controlnet|ip.*adapter|batch"
    symptoms:
      - CUDA out of memory errors
      - System freeze during generation
      - Workflow only works with tiny batch sizes
    solution: |
      1. Use FP16/FP8 quantized models
      2. Reduce batch size to 1
      3. Lower resolution, upscale after
      4. Enable tiled VAE decode
      5. Close other GPU applications
      6. Consider cloud GPU (RunPod, etc.)
    technical_detail: >
      FLUX.2 with FP8 requires 40% less VRAM than full precision

  - id: git-lfs-missing-assets
    severity: high
    title: Lost Assets from Missing Git LFS
    description: >
      AI generation is non-deterministic. Same prompt + seed doesn't
      guarantee identical output. Lost assets cannot be regenerated.
      Without Git LFS, large assets aren't properly tracked.
    detection_pattern: "git|version.*control|backup"
    symptoms:
      - Binary files too large for git
      - Assets lost after branch switch
      - Cannot reproduce exact asset
    solution: |
      1. Set up Git LFS before first generation
      2. Track all binary formats: *.png, *.jpg, *.psd, *.blend
      3. Use lockable files for unmergeable assets
      4. Document prompts + seeds + model versions
      5. Store ComfyUI workflow JSON with assets

    severity: medium
    title: AI-Generated Assets May Not Be Copyrightable
    description: >
      US Copyright Office 2025: AI-generated content without meaningful
      human input is NOT copyrightable. Cannot prevent others from
      using similar imagery.
    detection_pattern: "copyright|protect|legal"
    symptoms:
      - Cannot DMCA takedown similar assets
      - Competitors can legally use similar AI outputs
      - No exclusive ownership of asset designs
    solution: |
      1. Add significant human modification to establish copyright
      2. Document human creative decisions
      3. Use AI as starting point, not final product
      4. Consider trademark protection for distinctive elements
      5. Protect via trade secret (don't publish prompts/methods)
