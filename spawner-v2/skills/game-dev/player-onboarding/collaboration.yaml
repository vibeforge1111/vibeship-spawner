# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Cognitive Psychology
    insight: |
      Psychologists understand learning:
      - Working memory holds 4 items, not 7 (recent research)
      - Spaced repetition beats cramming
      - Active learning beats passive watching
      - Immediate feedback accelerates learning
      - Anxiety impairs memory formation
      - "Desirable difficulty" strengthens retention

      Game onboarding is applied cognitive science.
      Every teaching moment should respect these limits.
    applies_when: "Designing teaching moments and information pacing"

  - domain: Education/Pedagogy
    insight: |
      Teachers know scaffolding:
      - Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)
      - Gradual release of responsibility
      - Formative vs summative assessment
      - Differentiated instruction
      - The power of immediate feedback
      - Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation

      Good tutorials are good teaching.
      The game is the best teacher when designed right.
    applies_when: "Structuring learning progression and difficulty curves"

  - domain: UX Research
    insight: |
      UX researchers know user behavior:
      - Users don't read, they scan
      - First impressions form in 50ms
      - Friction compounds exponentially
      - Progressive disclosure reduces overwhelm
      - Users blame themselves for bad UX
      - Context determines expectations

      Every tutorial is a UX problem.
      Observe, measure, iterate.
    applies_when: "Playtesting and iterating on onboarding flow"

  - domain: Behavioral Economics
    insight: |
      Economists understand motivation:
      - Loss aversion (fear > desire)
      - Endowment effect (value what we have)
      - Sunk cost fallacy (keep playing if invested)
      - Variable rewards (slot machine effect)
      - IKEA effect (value what we build)
      - Commitment and consistency

      Player hooks are behavioral nudges.
      The first session plants retention seeds.
    applies_when: "Designing return hooks and first session goals"

  - domain: Film/Storytelling
    insight: |
      Filmmakers know pacing:
      - In medias res (start in the middle)
      - Show don't tell
      - Save the cat moment (immediate likability)
      - The promise of the premise
      - Every scene earns its place
      - Tension and release

      Opening moments are your movie trailer.
      Hook them in 30 seconds or lose them.
    applies_when: "Designing the first 30 seconds and 3 minutes"

  - domain: Mobile App Growth
    insight: |
      Growth hackers know acquisition:
      - Time to value is everything
      - Day 1 retention predicts lifetime
      - The 3-minute mobile rule
      - Push notification timing
      - Re-engagement triggers
      - Viral loops start in onboarding

      Mobile FTUE is growth engineering.
