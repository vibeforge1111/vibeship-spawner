# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Godot Community
    insight: |
      Godot developers value simplicity:
      - Prefer GDScript over plugins when possible
      - Scene tree is the architecture
      - Signals over direct calls
      - Open source ethos
      NobodyWho fits this philosophy well.
    applies_when: "Designing Godot-native LLM solutions"

  - domain: Interactive Fiction
    insight: |
      IF authors know dialogue:
      - Parser-based interaction is natural
      - State tracking is essential
      - Grammar matters for intent
      NobodyWho's grammar feature bridges IF and games.
    applies_when: "Building narrative-heavy games"

  - domain: Rust Systems Programming
    insight: |
      NobodyWho is written in Rust:
      - Memory safety without GC
      - Excellent cross-platform compilation
      - Performance close to C++
      Understanding this helps debug edge cases.
    applies_when: "Debugging NobodyWho native issues"
