    title: "Loot Boxes Are Illegal in Some Regions"
    description: |
      Belgium and Netherlands have banned paid loot boxes as gambling.
      Japan bans "kompu gacha" (complete gacha). China requires rate disclosure.
      Selling loot boxes in banned regions can result in store removal and fines.
    symptoms:
      - "App rejected in Belgium/Netherlands"
      - "Legal notice from gaming authority"
      - "Store removal threat"
      - "Refund demands citing gambling laws"
    solution: |
      1. Geo-gate loot box features by region
      2. Offer direct purchase alternatives in regulated markets
      3. Always disclose probabilities globally
      4. Consult legal counsel before launching gacha systems

      ```javascript
      // Region-aware gacha system
      const gachaAvailability = {
        BE: { available: false, alternative: 'direct_purchase' },
        NL: { available: false, alternative: 'direct_purchase' },
        JP: { available: true, restrictions: ['no_kompu_gacha'] },
        CN: { available: true, restrictions: ['show_rates', 'spending_limits'] },
        US: { available: true, restrictions: [] },
        DEFAULT: { available: true, restrictions: ['show_rates'] }
      };

      function canShowGacha(region) {
        const config = gachaAvailability[region] || gachaAvailability.DEFAULT;
        return config.available;
      }
      ```

    title: "COPPA Violations for Under-13 Spending"
    description: |
      If your game is directed at or collects data from children under 13,
      COPPA requires parental consent for purchases. FTC fines can exceed $50,000
      per violation.
    symptoms:
      - "FTC inquiry letter"
      - "Parental complaint about unauthorized purchase"
      - "Store age-rating mismatch with content"
    solution: |
      1. Implement age gate if content appeals to children
      2. Require parental consent for IAP in kids' games
      3. Use platform parental controls (Ask to Buy on iOS)
      4. Keep detailed records of consent mechanisms

      ```javascript
      // Age-appropriate purchase flow
      async function initiatePurchase(playerId, itemId) {
        const player = await getPlayer(playerId);

        if (player.age < 13 || player.ageUnverified) {
          // Require parental gate
          const parentApproved = await requestParentalConsent(playerId, {
            item: itemId,
            price: getPrice(itemId),
            method: 'PIN_OR_EMAIL'
          });

          if (!parentApproved) {
            return { blocked: true, reason: 'PARENTAL_CONSENT_REQUIRED' };
          }
        }

        return processPurchase(playerId, itemId);

    severity: critical
    title: "Chargeback Rate Can Get You Banned from Payment Processors"
    description: |
      Payment processors (and app stores) ban merchants with chargeback rates
      above 1%. Aggressive monetization leads to buyer's remorse and chargebacks.
      Once banned, you cannot process payments.
    symptoms:
      - "Chargeback rate exceeding 0.5%"
      - "Warning letter from payment processor"
      - "Spike in 'unauthorized purchase' disputes"
      - "App store threatening removal"
    solution: |
      1. Implement spending limits and cooldowns
      2. Send purchase confirmation emails
      3. Make refund process easy (reduces chargebacks)
      4. Monitor chargeback rate daily

      ```javascript
      // Proactive chargeback prevention
      class ChargebackPrevention {
        async onPurchase(purchase) {
          // 1. Send confirmation email immediately
          await sendConfirmationEmail(purchase.playerId, purchase);

          // 2. Check for unusual patterns
          const riskScore = await this.calculateRiskScore(purchase);
          if (riskScore > 0.7) {
            await this.flagForReview(purchase);
            await this.sendReceiptReminder(purchase, '24h');
          }

          // 3. Track for early warning
          await this.updateChargebackMetrics();
          const rate = await this.getChargebackRate('30d');
          if (rate > 0.005) { // 0.5% warning threshold
            await this.alertTeam('CHARGEBACK_WARNING', { rate });
          }
        }

        async handleRefundRequest(playerId, purchaseId, reason) {
          // Make refunds easy - it's cheaper than chargebacks
          const purchase = await getPurchase(purchaseId);

          if (purchase.age < 48 * 60 * 60 * 1000) { // Within 48 hours
            await this.processRefund(purchase);
            return { refunded: true };
          }

          // Older purchases: offer in-game compensation instead
          return { offer: 'IN_GAME_CREDIT', value: purchase.amount * 1.2 };

  # === ECONOMY DESIGN ===
  - id: hyperinflation-spiral
    severity: high
    title: "Economy Inflation Makes Purchases Feel Worthless"
    description: |
      When currency rewards scale faster than sinks, the economy inflates.
      Players who spent $100 early see their purchases become trivial.
      This is the #1 cause of veteran player churn in live service games.
    symptoms:
      - "Veteran players complaining about 'wasted money'"
      - "New players catching up too quickly"
      - "Currency rewards per hour increasing over time"
      - "Items that used to be premium now feel cheap"
    solution: |
      1. Model economy before launch with spreadsheets
      2. Implement proportional sinks that scale with rewards
      3. Use currency tiers (bronze/silver/gold) for segmentation
      4. Monitor currency velocity weekly

      ```javascript
      // Economy health monitoring
      class EconomyMonitor {
        async dailyHealthCheck() {
          const metrics = {
            currencyInCirculation: await this.getTotalCurrency(),
            currencyVelocity: await this.getVelocity('24h'),
            sourceBreakdown: await this.getSourceBreakdown('24h'),
            sinkBreakdown: await this.getSinkBreakdown('24h'),
            netFlow: await this.getNetFlow('24h')
          };

          // Alert on inflation
          if (metrics.netFlow > metrics.currencyInCirculation * 0.01) {
            await this.alert('INFLATION_WARNING', {
              message: 'Net positive flow exceeds 1% of circulation',
              metrics
            });
          }

          // Alert on deflation (also bad - players feel stuck)
          if (metrics.netFlow < -metrics.currencyInCirculation * 0.005) {
            await this.alert('DEFLATION_WARNING', {
              message: 'Economy contracting - players may feel progression blocked',
              metrics
            });

  - id: pay-to-win-backlash
    severity: high
    title: "Pay-to-Win Destroys Communities Permanently"
    description: |
      Once labeled 'pay-to-win', a game rarely recovers. The community becomes
      toxic, reviews tank, and free players (who are content for paying players)
      leave. Even removing P2W later doesn't restore trust.
    symptoms:
      - "Steam reviews mentioning 'pay to win' or 'P2W'"
      - "Reddit posts calculating 'dollars per power'"
      - "Competitive players quitting"
      - "Streamers refusing to cover the game"
    solution: |
      1. NEVER sell power that can't be earned
      2. If selling time-savers, ensure time investment is reasonable
      3. Keep competitive modes completely F2P
      4. Get community feedback before launching new monetization

      ```javascript
      // P2W prevention checklist
      const monetizationReview = {
        item: 'New Sword',
        stats: { damage: 150, critChance: 0.15 },

        checks: {
          canBeEarned: true, // REQUIRED
          earnTime: '20 hours', // Must be reasonable
          earnMethod: 'Raid boss drop',

          competitiveImpact: 'low', // Must be low or none
          alternatives: ['Craftable Sword (same stats)'],

          communityReaction: null // Poll before launch!
        },

        approved: function() {
          return this.checks.canBeEarned &&
                 this.checks.competitiveImpact !== 'high' &&

  - id: first-purchase-friction
    severity: high
    title: "First Purchase Has 100x More Friction Than Second"
    description: |
      Converting a non-payer to a payer is the hardest monetization challenge.
      Once someone has paid once, they're 10-100x more likely to pay again.
      Pricing and UX for first purchase must be optimized separately.
    symptoms:
      - "Low conversion rate (<2%)"
      - "High ARPPU but low paying user %"
      - "Starter packs not selling"
      - "Players buying only during sales"
    solution: |
      1. Offer exceptional value starter packs ($0.99-$4.99)
      2. Make first purchase risk-free (no regret)
      3. Remove all friction from first purchase flow
      4. Track first purchase conversion as key metric

      ```javascript
      // First purchase optimization
      const starterPack = {
        price: 0.99,
        value: 10.00, // 10x value for first purchase

        contents: {
          premiumCurrency: 500, // Worth $4.99 alone
          exclusiveCosmetic: 'Founder Badge', // Can't get elsewhere
          boosts: ['7-day VIP', '2x XP 24h'],
          resources: { gold: 10000, energy: 100 }
        },

        restrictions: {
          onePerAccount: true,
          availableUntil: 'day 7', // Creates urgency
          displayPrompt: 'after_tutorial'
        },

        // Track meticulously

  # === PLATFORM ECONOMICS ===
  - id: platform-fee-miscalculation
    severity: high
    title: "Platform Fees Eat 30% of Revenue (or more)"
    description: |
      Apple and Google take 30% of IAP revenue (15% for small developers).
      Steam takes 30% (down to 20% at high volume). Payment processors add 2-3%.
      Many developers price without accounting for this and lose money.
    symptoms:
      - "Actual revenue 30%+ below projections"
      - "Negative unit economics on small purchases"
      - "Confusion about net vs gross revenue"
    solution: |
      1. Always calculate net revenue (after fees)
      2. Consider minimum purchase thresholds
      3. Factor fees into LTV calculations
      4. Evaluate alternative distribution channels

      ```javascript
      // Revenue calculation with platform fees
      const platformFees = {
        ios: {
          standard: 0.30,
          smallBusiness: 0.15, // Under $1M/year
          subscription: 0.15   // After year 1
        },
        android: {
          standard: 0.30,
          smallBusiness: 0.15
        },
        steam: {
          tier1: 0.30,         // Under $10M
          tier2: 0.25,         // $10M-$50M
          tier3: 0.20          // Over $50M
        },
        payment: 0.029 + 0.30  // Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30
      };

      function calculateNetRevenue(grossRevenue, platform, isSmallBusiness = true) {
        const feeRate = isSmallBusiness ?
          platformFees[platform].smallBusiness :
          platformFees[platform].standard;

        return grossRevenue * (1 - feeRate);
      }

      // Example: $0.99 purchase on iOS (small business)
      // Net = $0.99 * 0.85 = $0.84
      // If item cost $0.50 to create: $0.34 profit

      // Example: $0.99 purchase on iOS (standard)
      // Net = $0.99 * 0.70 = $0.69
      // If item cost $0.50 to create: $0.19 profit (45% less!)

    severity: medium
    title: "Single Global Price Kills Emerging Market Revenue"
    description: |
      $9.99 USD is unaffordable in many countries. Without regional pricing,
      you get zero revenue from players who would pay $2.99 in their currency.
      You're leaving 40-60% of potential global revenue on the table.
    symptoms:
      - "Low conversion in Brazil, India, Turkey, etc."
      - "High usage but zero revenue from emerging markets"
      - "Players requesting regional pricing"
    solution: |
      1. Implement PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) pricing
      2. Use platform's regional pricing tools
      3. Price to local market standards, not USD conversion
      4. Monitor for VPN arbitrage

      ```javascript
      // Regional pricing matrix (example)
      const regionalPricing = {
        // Developed markets - full price
        US: { multiplier: 1.0, currency: 'USD' },

        DE: { multiplier: 1.0, currency: 'EUR' },
        JP: { multiplier: 1.0, currency: 'JPY' },

        // Emerging markets - adjusted for PPP
        BR: { multiplier: 0.4, currency: 'BRL' },  // 60% discount
        IN: { multiplier: 0.3, currency: 'INR' },  // 70% discount
        TR: { multiplier: 0.35, currency: 'TRY' }, // 65% discount
        RU: { multiplier: 0.4, currency: 'RUB' },  // 60% discount
        MX: { multiplier: 0.5, currency: 'MXN' },  // 50% discount

    description: |
      "Only 100 left!" counters that reset, "limited time" offers that return
      monthly, and fake urgency destroy player trust when discovered.
      Players share this information and it spreads quickly.
    symptoms:
      - "Reddit posts exposing 'fake limited' items"
      - "Players cynically ignoring all limited offers"
      - "Trust metrics declining"
      - "Conversion dropping on legitimate limited offers"
    solution: |
      1. If it's limited, make it actually limited
      2. If it returns, say "seasonal" not "limited"
      3. Use countdown timers only for real deadlines
      4. Be transparent about rotation schedules

    description: |
      Designing systems that prey on "I've already spent $X, I can't stop now"
      leads to spending far beyond player intent. This causes massive regret,
      chargebacks, negative reviews, and regulatory attention.
    symptoms:

      - "Spending concentrated in small percentage of players"
      - "Whales churning after large spending sprees"
    solution: |
      1. Implement spending notifications at thresholds
      2. Show lifetime spend in purchase flow
