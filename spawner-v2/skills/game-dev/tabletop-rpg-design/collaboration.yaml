      with_context: |
        Dice mechanic, target distributions, success rate goals
      reason: Mathematical modeling requires specialized tools

    - situation: Character sheet layout and visual design
      escalate_to: ui-design
      with_context: |
        Information hierarchy, frequency of reference, playbook pattern

    - situation: Deep worldbuilding beyond mechanical implication
      escalate_to: worldbuilding
      with_context: |
        What mechanics imply about world, tone, genre expectations
      reason: Setting depth shouldn't be mechanically driven alone

      escalate_to: packaging-print-production
      with_context: |
        Page count, binding type, print run expectations, zine vs hardcover

         Act 2: Rising heat and faction conflict (sessions 4-8)
         Act 3: Climax and resolution (sessions 9-12)"

        # Narrative Design provides content:
        "Act 2 Story Beats:

        # Game Balance calculates:
        "+3 stat: 10+ = 83.3% (too easy for 'hard')
         +1 stat: 10+ = 58.3% (fits 'standard')
         -1 stat: 10+ = 27.8% (fits 'hard')
         Recommendation: Standard task for average (+1) character."

        # Designer adjusts:
        "Easy = no roll needed. Standard = 10+ success.
