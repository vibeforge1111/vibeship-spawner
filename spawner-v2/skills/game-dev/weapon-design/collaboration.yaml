cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Prop Making (WETA Workshop)
    insight: |
      Master prop makers know:
      - Weapons must be holdable, even fantasy ones
      - Materials dictate form (steel bends, wood cracks)
      - Function informs decoration (guards protect, pommels balance)
      - Hero props vs stunt props serve different purposes
      If WETA couldn't forge it, redesign it.

    insight: |
      Animators know:
      - Silhouette must read in motion
      - Weight requires follow-through
      - Anticipation telegraphs power
      - Weapon design constrains animation
      Static designs become dynamic performances.
    applies_when: "Designing for combat systems"
