# ============================================
# VOXEL-SPECIFIC COLLABORATION NOTES
# ============================================

voxel_specific_notes:
  palette_sharing: |
    All voxel artists on a project should use the same palette file.
    This ensures:
      - Consistent look across all assets
      - Assets can share materials in engine
      - Easier to adjust overall look later

    Workflow:
      1. Lead artist creates master palette
      2. All artists import same palette
      3. Changes go through lead artist
      4. Palette file versioned in source control

  resolution_standardization: |
    Projects should define standard resolutions:
      - Small prop: 16x16x16
      - Large prop: 32x32x32
      - Character: 24x24x48 or 32x32x64
      - Environment module: 32x32x32

    This ensures:
      - Consistent visual density
      - Predictable performance
      - Assets work together visually

  animation_coordination: |
    Frame-by-frame animation requires coordination:
      - Share frame count standards (4, 6, 8 typical)
      - Share timing conventions (2 frames per pose?)
      - Use same preview workflow
      - Coordinate storage budget

  mesh_handoff_notes: |
    When handing off to 3d-modeling for optimization:
      - Export as OBJ (not marching cubes) for blocky look
      - Include palette PNG
      - Document which colors are which materials
      - Note any faces that should stay as-is
