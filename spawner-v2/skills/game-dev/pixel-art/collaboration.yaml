# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Traditional Animation (Disney's 12 Principles)
    insight: |
      Animators know that great motion comes from:
      - Squash and stretch (subpixel in our world)
      - Anticipation before action
      - Follow-through after action
      - Timing and spacing (fewer frames, more impact)
      - Exaggeration (clearer at low resolution)
      Even with 4 frames, these principles create life.
    applies_when: "Creating any animation, especially attack and movement cycles"

  - domain: Industrial Design (Constraints as Tools)
    insight: |
      Designers like Dieter Rams embraced constraints:
      "Less, but better."
      A 16-color palette isn't a limitation—it's a design tool
      that forces cohesion and intentionality.
      Every pixel must justify its existence.
    applies_when: "Defining palette limits and sprite sizes"

  - domain: Typography (Readability at Small Sizes)
    insight: |
      Type designers know that small sizes need:
      - Higher x-height (larger features)
      - Simpler forms (less detail)
      - More contrast (bolder strokes)
      - Optical adjustments (things that "look right")
      Pixel art characters follow the same rules.
    applies_when: "Designing small sprites (16x16 or smaller)"

  - domain: NES-Era Game Development
    insight: |
      Developers working within NES constraints learned:
      - Reuse sprites by flipping/palette-swapping
      - Animate through color changes (subpixel)
      - Use black backgrounds to hide sprite limits
      - Make limitations look intentional
      Constraints breed creativity.
    applies_when: "Creating retro-authentic pixel art"

  - domain: Photography (Composition)
    insight: |
      Photographers compose with limited frame:
      - Clear subject (silhouette)
      - Negative space (don't fill every pixel)
      - Leading lines (outline direction)
      - Rule of thirds (even at 32x32)
      Composition principles scale down.
    applies_when: "Composing sprite poses and scene elements"

      Include loop information (which animations loop, ping-pong, or play once).
      Specify which frame in attack animations is the "active" hitbox frame.

      If concept has too much detail for pixel size, simplification is required.
      Pixel artist should flag concepts that won't translate well.
