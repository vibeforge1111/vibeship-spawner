# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Psychology
    insight: |
      Game designers are applied psychologists:
      - Self-Determination Theory: Autonomy, competence, relatedness
      - Flow state: Balance between challenge and skill
      - Variable ratio reinforcement: Why loot boxes work
      - Loss aversion: Why failure feels worse than success feels good
      - Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation: Why some rewards backfire

      The best game designers study behavioral psychology.
    applies_when: "Designing motivation, rewards, and engagement systems"

  - domain: Film & Theater
    insight: |
      Directors know pacing:
      - Three-act structure applies to sessions
      - Tension and release create rhythm
      - "Show, don't tell" is universal
      - Every scene serves the story (every mechanic serves the experience)
      - The rule of threes for learning

      Games are interactive cinema. Borrow liberally.
    applies_when: "Designing game pacing, tutorials, and emotional moments"

  - domain: Sports & Athletics
    insight: |
      Athletes know feel:
      - Muscle memory develops through repetition
      - Feedback must be instant
      - "In the zone" is real and designable
      - Skill expression is intrinsically satisfying
      - The best equipment becomes invisible

      Game feel is digital sports feel. Study athletes.
    applies_when: "Designing controls, responsiveness, and skill expression"

  - domain: Architecture & Urban Planning
    insight: |
      Architects know flow:
      - People move through spaces predictably
      - Sight lines guide attention
      - Landmarks aid navigation
      - Rhythm in spaces creates experience
      - Form follows function

      Level designers are digital architects.
    applies_when: "Working with level design and environmental guidance"

  - domain: Music & Composition
    insight: |
      Musicians know structure:
      - Theme and variation create coherence
      - Repetition with difference is satisfying
      - Dynamics create emotion
      - Silence is as important as sound
      - Counterpoint creates richness

      Game loops are musical structures.
    applies_when: "Designing core loops and game rhythm"

  - domain: Economics
    insight: |
      Economists know systems:
      - Supply and demand shape behavior
      - Inflation destroys economies
      - Incentives drive action (often unexpectedly)
      - Markets find exploits
      - Every intervention has side effects

      Game economies are real economies in miniature.
    applies_when: "Designing game economies and resource systems"

  - domain: Education
    insight: |
      Teachers know learning:
      - Zone of proximal development (challenge at the edge of ability)
      - Scaffolding (support that fades)
      - Spaced repetition (revisit concepts)
      - Active learning beats passive
      - Immediate feedback accelerates learning

      Games are the most powerful learning tools ever made.
    applies_when: "Designing onboarding and skill progression"
