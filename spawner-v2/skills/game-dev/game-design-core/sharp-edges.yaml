# Game Design Core Sharp Edges
# The design mistakes that kill games - learned from post-mortems and playtests

sharp_edges:
  - id: core-loop-afterthought
    summary: Building systems before proving the core loop is fun
    severity: critical
    situation: Adding progression, economy, story, or polish to a game whose moment-to-moment gameplay hasn't been validated
    why: |
      The core loop is the foundation. If shooting isn't fun, no amount of unlockable
      guns will save it. If matching isn't satisfying, progression won't matter.
      Every hour spent on meta-systems for a broken core is wasted. You cannot
      polish a rock into a diamond. Most cancelled games die here: the team builds
      outward from a core that was never proven.
    solution: |
      The Gray Box Test:
      1. Build the core mechanic with programmer art
      2. No progression, no rewards, no story
      3. Play it for 10 minutes
      4. Is it fun yet?

      If no: iterate on the core
      If yes: now add one layer

      Valve's approach:
      - Orange Box prototype
      - Playtest daily
      - Core loop locked before production

      Ask: "Would I play this with no rewards?"
      If the answer is no, the core is broken.
    symptoms:
      - "It'll be fun once we add progression"
      - Core loop not playtested standalone
      - Adding features to hide core problems
      - Designer knows the game isn't fun but is "waiting for it to come together"
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: feature-creep-spiral
    summary: Adding features without cutting scope
    severity: critical
    situation: Every idea becomes a feature, no ideas are killed, scope only grows
    why: |
      Every feature has hidden costs:
      - Implementation time
      - Testing time
      - Balancing time
      - Tutorial/teaching time
      - Maintenance time
      - Interaction with other features

      A game with 20 half-finished features is worse than one with 5 polished
      features. Players don't count features - they feel quality. The game that
      ships beats the game that doesn't.

      Sid Meier's rule: "Take out what doesn't work, not what you like."
    solution: |
      The Feature Test (for every proposed feature):
      1. Does this improve the core loop?
      2. What do we cut to make time for this?
      3. Would players miss it if we shipped without it?

      If you can't answer #2, you can't add the feature.

      Scope Management:
      - Kill features publicly and celebrate cuts
      - "Feature graveyard" document
      - Every addition needs a subtraction
      - Playable builds at every stage

      The Three-Feature Rule:
      What are the three things players will remember?
      Everything else is negotiable.
    symptoms:
      - Feature list only grows, never shrinks
      - "We'll add that too"
      - No features cut in months
      - Team afraid to say no to ideas
      - Release date keeps slipping
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: designing-for-yourself
    summary: Building the game you want, not the game your audience wants
    severity: critical
    situation: Designer preferences override playtest data, target audience not defined
    why: |
      You are the worst possible playtester for your own game:
      - You know every secret
      - You understand every system
      - You have hundreds of hours of practice
      - You know the designer intent

      Fresh players have none of this. What's obvious to you is invisible to them.
      Your muscle memory is their learning curve. Your "easy" is their "impossible."
    solution: |
      The Stranger Test:
      1. Find someone who's never seen the game
      2. Sit them in front of it
      3. Say nothing
      4. Take notes on everything they struggle with

      Golden rules of playtest observation:
      - Never explain anything
      - Never defend any choice
      - "Why did you do that?" not "You should have..."
      - Watch hands and face, not screen

      Target Audience Definition:
      - Write a player persona
      - Name them, give them a life
      - Design for them, not you

      If you have to explain why something is fun, it isn't.
    symptoms:
      - "They're playing it wrong"
      - "They just need to read the tutorial"
      - No external playtests
      - Designer is their own primary tester
      - Target audience is "gamers"
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: complexity-masquerading-as-depth
    summary: Adding more systems thinking it creates strategic depth
    severity: high
    situation: Game has many interconnected systems but decisions still feel obvious
    why: |
      Complexity != Depth

      Complexity: How many things can I do?
      Depth: How many interesting decisions emerge?

      Chess has 6 piece types. Go has 1 stone type.
      Both have infinite depth.

      More systems create:
      - Cognitive overload
      - Spreadsheet gameplay
      - Analysis paralysis
      - "I'll just do what worked last time"

      Depth comes from interesting interactions between simple systems,
      not from system count.
    solution: |
      The Simplification Test:
      1. Remove one system entirely
      2. Does the game get worse?
      3. If not, it was complexity, not depth

      Signs of true depth:
      - Experts play differently than beginners
      - Debates exist about "best" strategy
      - Meta evolves over time
      - High-level play looks different

      Design for elegant interactions:
      - Few rules, many outcomes
      - Mechanics that combine interestingly
      - Emergent complexity from simple parts

      Mark Rosewater's lesson from Magic:
      "Restrictions breed creativity."
    symptoms:
      - Players use guides to understand basic play
      - New players overwhelmed
      - No emergent strategies
      - Dominant strategies exist despite complexity
      - Adding more to solve "it feels shallow"
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: tutorial-as-bandaid
    summary: Using tutorials to fix unintuitive design
    severity: high
    situation: Adding more tutorial text because players don't understand a mechanic
    why: |
      Tutorials are a tax on player patience. Every tutorial popup is an admission
      that the design failed to communicate. Players skip tutorials. Players forget
      tutorials. Players resent tutorials.

      If your design needs explaining, the design is the problem.

      Miyamoto's observation: "Players should understand the game just by playing it."
    solution: |
      The No-Tutorial Test:
      - Remove all tutorial text
      - Can a player figure out the basics?
      - If not, redesign, don't re-explain

      Environmental Teaching:
      - Level design guides attention
      - Gating requires demonstrated understanding
      - Safe spaces to experiment

      Just-In-Time Over Just-In-Case:
      - Teach when relevant, not before
      - Show, don't tell
      - Let players discover

      Nintendo's Approach (Super Mario):
      1. First goomba can't kill you
      2. First pit can be walked around
      3. First mystery block is obvious
      4. Complexity builds on mastered basics

      If players need the tutorial, your first level failed.
    symptoms:
      - Tutorial text growing longer
      - "We'll explain it in the tutorial"
      - Players skip tutorial and fail
      - Multiple tutorials added over development
      - Tutorials for every system

  - id: balanced-means-boring
    summary: Pursuing perfect balance at the expense of fun
    severity: high
    situation: All options are equally viable, no option feels powerful
    why: |
      Perfect balance means no decisions matter. If all weapons are equal,
      picking one is meaningless. If all characters are the same power level,
      character selection is cosmetic.

      Players want to find "the good stuff." Discovery is fun. Power spikes
      are memorable. "Broken" combos become stories.

      Blizzard's philosophy: "Everything is overpowered, so nothing is."
    solution: |
      Strategic Imbalance:
      - Intentional power differences
      - Rock-paper-scissors relationships
      - Contextual strength (situationally powerful)

      Meta Management:
      - Rotate balance patches
      - Let players discover before nerfing
      - "Flavor of the month" keeps game fresh

      The Fun Imbalance:
      - Early game: Obvious best options (help new players)
      - Mid game: Situational choices emerge
      - Late game: Everything viable at high skill

      Fighting Game Wisdom:
      - Tier lists create metagame
      - Low-tier heroes are for showing off
      - Perfect balance = dead scene
    symptoms:
      - All options perform identically
      - No discussions about "meta"
      - No discovery moments
      - Purely skill matchups (options irrelevant)
      - Constant nerfs, never buffs

  - id: punishment-over-teaching
    summary: Making failure painful instead of instructive
    severity: high
    situation: Large penalties for death/failure, long setbacks, frustrating loss loops
    why: |
      Punishment doesn't teach - it discourages.

      When failure hurts too much:
      - Players stop experimenting
      - Risk-taking dies
      - Frustration builds
      - Players quit

      The goal is learning, not suffering. Dead players should know WHY they
      died and be EXCITED to try again.

      Dark Souls works not because it's hard, but because death is fast and
      teaching is clear.
    solution: |
      Failure as Information:
      - Clear cause of death
      - Quick restart
      - Minimal lost progress
      - Visible improvement path

      The Roguelike Model:
      - Death resets run, not learning
      - Each attempt teaches something
      - Progression happens despite death
      - "I almost had it" feeling

      Punishment Budget:
      - 10 seconds of pain, max
      - Quick feedback loop
      - Try again in < 30 seconds

      Celeste's Approach:
      - Instant respawn
      - Room-by-room checkpoints
      - Death is expected
      - Assist mode available
    symptoms:
      - Long reload/respawn times
      - Large progress loss on death
      - Players save-scumming
      - Rage quits at specific points
      - Unfair death complaints
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: engagement-through-obligation
    summary: Using FOMO, dailies, and artificial friction to retain players
    severity: high
    situation: Daily rewards that disappear, limited-time events, wait timers
    why: |
      There's a difference between:
      - Players wanting to play
      - Players afraid to miss out

      Obligation creates resentment. Players feel trapped, not engaged.
      When they finally quit, they quit forever. You've traded short-term
      retention for long-term hatred.

      These games are remembered as manipulative, not fun.
    solution: |
      Desire Over Duty:
      - Make returning feel good, not missing feel bad
      - Rewards for playing, not penalties for absence
      - Respect player time

      Sustainable Engagement:
      - Players should want to play, not feel forced
      - "I want to play" > "I have to play"
      - Leave players wanting more, not dreading less

      The Breath of Fresh Air Test:
      Would players miss this if they took a week off?
      If they'd feel RELIEVED to skip, you've built a prison.

      Exception: Games explicitly designed as habits (fitness apps, language learning)
      Even then, gentle encouragement > punishment.
    symptoms:
      - Streak mechanics
      - Disappearing rewards
      - FOMO-driven events
      - Players complaining about "having to" play
      - High churn after streak breaks
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: ignoring-playtest-data
    summary: Dismissing player feedback because it conflicts with designer vision
    severity: critical
    situation: Playtests show problems, designer argues players are wrong
    why: |
      There is no "wrong" way to play. If players consistently:
      - Fail at the same point
      - Misunderstand the same mechanic
      - Skip the same content
      - Get frustrated at the same moment

      That's not a player problem. That's a design problem.

      Players are always right about their experience. They might be wrong
      about solutions, but they're never wrong about their feelings.
    solution: |
      The Observation Rule:
      - Watch, don't explain
      - Note patterns, not individuals
      - Three players same problem = design problem

      Data Over Opinion:
      - Heatmaps > hunches
      - Completion rates > intentions
      - Time-in-section > designer estimates

      Designer Humility:
      - "Why do players do this?" not "Players shouldn't do this"
      - Design for actual behavior, not ideal behavior
      - Your intent is invisible to players

      Post-Playtest Process:
      1. What did they struggle with?
      2. Where did they quit?
      3. What did they skip?
      4. What made them laugh/smile?
      5. What would they change?

      Actions speak louder than feedback forms.
    symptoms:
      - Explaining away negative feedback
      - "They just need to learn"
      - Same issues in multiple playtests
      - Designer defends during feedback
      - Changes not made after playtests

  - id: over-designing-before-prototyping
    summary: Writing detailed design documents for unvalidated ideas
    severity: high
    situation: Spending weeks on GDD before any playable prototype exists
    why: |
      Design documents are fiction until validated by play.

      You cannot design fun on paper. Fun emerges from play. The game in
      your head and the game on screen are different games. Every hour
      spent documenting unproven ideas is an hour not spent discovering
      what works.

      The industry graveyard is full of beautiful GDDs for games that
      were never fun.
    solution: |
      Prototype First:
      - Ugly but playable > Beautiful but theoretical
      - One week prototype > One month document
      - Find the fun, then document it

      Living Documentation:
      - Documents evolve with the game
      - Prototypes prove, documents record
      - Update docs after discoveries

      The Jonathan Blow Approach:
      - Write code, not docs
      - Play every day
      - Design emerges from play

      Minimum Viable Document:
      - Core loop (one paragraph)
      - Target experience (one sentence)
      - Three features that matter
      - Everything else discovered through play
    symptoms:
      - 100-page GDD, no prototype
      - Weeks of design before code
      - Detailed systems for unproven core
      - Design docs not updated after playtests
      - "It's all in the document"
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: optimizing-for-completionists
    summary: Designing late-game content as if most players will see it
    severity: medium
    situation: Spending equal effort on early and late game content
    why: |
      The harsh truth of player behavior:
      - 90% start your game
      - 50% finish the tutorial
      - 25% reach the midpoint
      - 10% see the credits
      - 5% do everything

      Every hour spent on 100% completion content is seen by almost no one.
      Your best content should be in the first 30 minutes, not the last.
    solution: |
      Front-Load Quality:
      - First impression is everything
      - Best content early
      - Diminishing returns on late-game polish

      Content Investment Strategy:
      - First hour: Maximum quality
      - Main path: High quality
      - Side content: Good quality
      - Completion content: Volume over quality

      The Netflix Principle:
      Viewers decide in 5 minutes. Players in 5 seconds.
      Your "skip" is their "uninstall."

      Completionist Content:
      - Quantity > polish
      - Reuse systems creatively
      - Let dedicated fans forgive rough edges
    symptoms:
      - Equal time on early/late content
      - Best set pieces at the end
      - Early game rushed for "the good part"
      - Retention drops at tutorial
      - "It gets good after 10 hours"

  - id: progression-as-fun-substitute
    summary: Relying on unlocks and numbers going up to create engagement
    why: |
      Progression systems can't make a boring game fun. They can only:
      - Extend engagement with an already-fun game
      - Provide goals to work toward
      - Create anticipation and pacing

      If the core loop isn't fun, players are just clicking through
      animations waiting for the next unlock. That's not engagement,
      that's sunk cost.

      The test: Would players still play with all content unlocked?
    situation: Players only engaged during unlock moments, bored between
    solution: |
      Progression as Enhancement:
      - Core loop must be fun at minute 1
      - Unlocks add variety, not fun
      - New content changes HOW you play, not WHETHER it's fun

      Roguelike Wisdom:
      - Run is fun independent of progression
      - Unlocks add variety, not viability
      - New players can still win

      The Core Loop Test:
      - Give a player all unlocks
      - Remove all progression
      - Is it still fun?

      If no: fix the core loop, not the progression.
    symptoms:
      - Excitement only at unlocks
      - Boredom between milestones
      - Players grinding, not playing
      - "When do I get to the good stuff?"
      - Progression skip purchases

  - id: kitchen-sink-design
    summary: Adding every mechanic that might be fun
    severity: high
    situation: Game tries to do everything, masters nothing
    why: |
      Every mechanic you add:
      - Competes for player attention
      - Needs teaching
      - Interacts with other mechanics
      - Can break or be broken

      A game that does 3 things exceptionally beats a game that does
      20 things adequately. Players remember what you do best, not
      what you also do.

      Pokemon is about catching creatures. The battles are simple.
      Breath of the Wild is about exploration. Combat is secondary.
      Celeste is about jumping. Story is minimal.
    solution: |
      The Focus Test:
      What is this game ABOUT? (One sentence)
      Everything supports this or gets cut.

      The Three-Feature Rule:
      Name three features players will remember.
      Those get 80% of your attention.

      System Justification:
      For every system, ask:
      - Does this make the core better?
      - Could the game ship without it?
      - What are we NOT doing because of this?

      Subtraction Design:
      Remove systems until removing one more would hurt.
      What remains is the game.
    symptoms:
      - "It's like X meets Y meets Z meets..."
      - Features compete for tutorials
      - Players confused about the point
      - Equal time on all systems
      - Can't describe in one sentence
