# =============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# =============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Psychology
    insight: |
      Behavioral psychologists understand reward schedules:
      - Variable ratio reinforcement (random rewards) is most addictive
      - Loss aversion makes "feels bad" moments hurt 2x more than wins feel good
      - Choice overload causes decision paralysis (3 options is ideal)
      - Sunk cost fallacy keeps players in losing games
      - Endowment effect makes owned cards feel more valuable

      Card game design is applied behavioral psychology. Use these insights
      ethically to create engagement, not exploitation.
    applies_when: "Designing reward structures, pack opening, and card acquisition"

  - domain: Economics
    insight: |
      Economists understand market dynamics:
      - Secondary market prices signal true card value
      - Artificial scarcity creates collectibility
      - Price floors (bulk) and ceilings (chase cards) define markets
      - Reprint policy affects long-term player trust
      - Format rotation manages supply and refreshes demand

      Every card game creates a micro-economy. Design with economic principles
      or face market failures (price crashes, speculation bubbles).
    applies_when: "Designing rarity, reprint policy, and rotation"

  - domain: Probability Theory
    insight: |
      Statisticians understand variance:
      - High variance creates memorable moments but frustrating averages
      - Low variance is consistent but can feel "solved"
      - Mulligan rules are variance mitigation
      - Best-of-3 reduces variance vs best-of-1
      - Card draw is already variance - be careful adding more

      Card games are probability engines. Understand the math or create
      games that feel random and unfair.
    applies_when: "Designing random effects, mulligan rules, and format structure"

  - domain: Competitive Games (Esports)
    insight: |
      Esports designers understand competitive integrity:
      - Skill expression must exceed luck over sample size
      - Information asymmetry creates skill gaps
      - Time controls prevent analysis paralysis
      - Spectator clarity enables esports viability
      - Sideboard/ban systems create meta skill tests

      If you want competitive play, design for skill expression. If casual,
      embrace variance for comeback potential.
    applies_when: "Designing for tournament play and competitive formats"

  - domain: Film/Theater
    insight: |
      Storytellers understand dramatic pacing:
      - Early game = rising action (building board)
      - Mid game = confrontation (trading blows)
      - Late game = climax (big plays, winner emerges)
      - Denouement = game end (clear winner)

      A good game tells a story. Mechanics that skip acts (turn 2 kills)
      or stall indefinitely (board stalls) break the narrative.
    applies_when: "Designing game pacing and win conditions"
