# Character Design Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that kill character appeal, readability, and memorability

sharp_edges:
  - id: detail-before-silhouette
    summary: Adding intricate details before establishing readable silhouette
    severity: critical
    situation: Designer starts with costume details, accessories, and textures before the basic shape works
    why: |
      The silhouette is your character's calling card. If it doesn't read at thumbnail size,
      no amount of beautiful rendering will save it. Mario, Sonic, and Link are recognizable
      as 16-pixel sprites because their silhouettes were designed first. Start with details
      and you'll end up with visual noise that "looks cool" but fails in actual gameplay.
    solution: |
      THE SILHOUETTE-FIRST WORKFLOW:

      STEP 1: Block out with solid shapes
        - Use only black fill
        - Design at thumbnail size (32-64px)
        - No details, just mass and proportion

      STEP 2: The Three-Shape Test
        - Can you describe silhouette with 3 simple shapes?
        - "Circle head, rectangle body, triangle cape"
        - If you need more than 3-4 shapes, simplify

      STEP 3: The Landmark Test
        - Identify 2-3 distinctive protrusions
        - These are your "landmarks" - visible at any scale
        - Examples: pointed ears, weapon on back, distinctive hair

      STEP 4: Only then add details
        - Details are earned by a working silhouette
        - Test after each addition: does silhouette still read?

      SILHOUETTE CHECKLIST:
      [ ] Recognizable at 32px?
      [ ] Asymmetrical (not boring mirrored shape)?
      [ ] Clear negative space (not a blob)?
      [ ] Distinctive landmarks (not generic humanoid)?
      [ ] Different from other characters in lineup?
    symptoms:
      - Character looks great in concept art but "muddy" in-game
      - Players can't identify character at gameplay distance
      - Character gets lost in busy environments
      - Silhouette looks like generic blob when filled black
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: over-designed-visual-noise
    summary: Adding too many elements until character becomes cluttered mess
    severity: critical
    situation: Every surface has a pattern, every limb has accessories, multiple focal points compete
    why: |
      The eye doesn't know where to look. At small scales, details blur into noise.
      The character looks "busy" rather than "detailed." Animation becomes nightmare.
      This is the #1 amateur mistake - equating complexity with quality.

      REMEMBER: Mario has red cap, blue overalls, mustache. That's it.
      Link has green tunic, pointed hat, sword. That's it.
      The masters know: simplicity = memorability.
    solution: |
      THE ELIMINATION AUDIT:

      For every design element, ask:
      1. Does removing this hurt the silhouette? (Keep if yes)
      2. Does removing this change who the character IS? (Keep if yes)
      3. Would anyone notice if this was gone? (Remove if no)

      THE 3-3-3 RULE:
      - Maximum 3 colors dominating the design
      - Maximum 3 major costume elements
      - Maximum 3 accessory focal points

      FOCAL POINT HIERARCHY:
      PRIMARY: One element draws the eye first (face usually)
      SECONDARY: One element draws eye second (weapon, hands)
      TERTIARY: Everything else supports, doesn't compete

      REDUCTION TECHNIQUE:
      1. Remove 30% of current details
      2. Test at 32px - better or worse?
      3. If better, remove another 20%
      4. Stop when removal makes it worse

      "If in doubt, leave it out." - Disney principle
    symptoms:
      - Eye doesn't know where to look
      - Character looks different at each viewing (no focal point)
      - Animation is difficult (too many moving parts)
      - Character doesn't scale down well
      - Design feels "try-hard" or "edgy for edgy's sake"
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: blob-silhouette-syndrome
    summary: Character reads as formless oval or generic humanoid shape
    severity: critical
    situation: Fill character with black and it's just a person-shaped blob with no distinction
    why: |
      A blob silhouette is invisible in gameplay. Players can't distinguish this character
      from any other. At small scales, the character disappears into backgrounds.
      This is why so many "realistic" characters fail - they look like everyone else.
    solution: |
      BLOB-BREAKING TECHNIQUES:

      1. ADD ASYMMETRY
         - Different arms/hands
         - Hair that breaks the head shape
         - Asymmetrical costume elements
         - One-sided accessories

      2. CREATE NEGATIVE SPACE
         - Legs apart in stance
         - Arms away from body
         - Cape or cloth that creates shapes
         - Gaps in costume (cutouts, openings)

      3. ADD LANDMARKS
         - Distinct head shape (ears, horns, hair, hat)
         - Weapon or tool silhouette
         - Unusual body proportion
         - Distinctive pose/stance

      4. EXAGGERATE ONE FEATURE
         - Oversized hands (fighters)
         - Tall thin frame (elegant characters)
         - Massive shoulders (tanks)
         - Distinctive leg shape (speedsters)

      THE "COULD THIS BE ANYONE?" TEST:
      Show silhouette to someone unfamiliar with your game.
      If they can't describe what makes it unique, it's a blob.

      EXAMPLES OF BLOB-BREAKERS:
      - Mario's cap shape
      - Sonic's head spikes
      - Megaman's arm cannon
      - Hollow Knight's horns and cape
    symptoms:
      - Character unrecognizable in silhouette
      - Could be mistaken for generic humanoid
      - No distinctive "landmark" features
      - Gets lost in busy environments
      - Fails the "lineup test" - too similar to others

  - id: colors-that-clash-or-vanish
    summary: Palette that breaks in different lighting or clashes with environments
    severity: high
    situation: Character looks great in concept art lighting but wrong in actual game environments
    why: |
      Characters exist in dynamic environments. Day/night cycles, different biomes,
      combat effects - your character must read clearly through all of it. A palette
      that only works in neutral studio lighting will fail in the real game.
    solution: |
      ENVIRONMENT-PROOF PALETTE DESIGN:

      STEP 1: Test in Extremes
      - Warm environment (sunset, fire, lava)
      - Cool environment (snow, night, underwater)
      - Neutral environment (grey, overcast)
      - High contrast (bright sun, deep shadow)

      STEP 2: Value Contrast
      - Light elements vs dark elements must maintain contrast
      - If character is all mid-tones, they'll vanish in mid-tone environments
      - Include at least one very light and one very dark value

      STEP 3: Saturation Anchor
      - One saturated color that "pops" in any environment
      - This color acts as visual anchor
      - Usually the primary character color

      STEP 4: Hue Distinction
      - Avoid environment-common hues as primary
      - Green character in forest = invisible
      - Blue character in water = invisible
      - UNLESS contrast through saturation/value

      COMMON FAILURES:
      - Red character + orange lava = character disappears
      - Blue character + blue sky = character disappears
      - Desaturated character + grey environment = invisible
      - High-saturation everything = eye strain, nothing pops

      THE FIVE-ENVIRONMENT TEST:
      Mock up character in Forest, Desert, Snow, Night, Lava.
      Readable in all five? Design passes.
    symptoms:
      - Character looks "different" in various game environments
      - Hard to see character in certain levels
      - Colors seem to "clash" with backgrounds
      - Players lose track of character during gameplay
      - Screenshots look wrong depending on environment

  - id: animation-breaking-design
    summary: Design that looks beautiful static but breaks when animated
    severity: high
    situation: Hair clips through body, arms can't reach where needed, proportions distort in motion
    why: |
      A character that can't be animated is useless for games. Beautiful concept art
      that creates animation nightmares wastes everyone's time. Designers must understand
      movement constraints, pivot points, and deformation.
    solution: |
      ANIMATION-FRIENDLY DESIGN RULES:

      1. JOINT CLEARANCE
         - Arms must reach face, weapon, ground
         - Legs must have full walk/run range
         - Head must rotate without hitting shoulders
         - Test key poses during design: T-pose, crouch, reach, attack

      2. HAIR AND CLOTH PHYSICS
         - Consider where long hair goes during movement
         - Capes/coats need attachment points
         - Loose elements need physics or pre-defined animation
         - Rule: If you can't explain how it moves, redesign it

      3. PROPORTION STABILITY
         - Foreshortening should maintain character recognition
         - Front/side/back views must be the same character
         - Extreme poses shouldn't reveal proportion impossibilities

      4. SILHOUETTE IN MOTION
         - Key animation poses must have clear silhouettes
         - Run cycle, attack, jump - all need readable silhouettes
         - Test: Would you recognize character mid-attack as black shape?

      5. AVOID DESIGN TRAPS
         - Excessive belts/straps (animation chaos)
         - Multiple floating elements (physics nightmare)
         - Impossible attachment points (where does this connect?)
         - Asymmetry that confuses direction (which way are they facing?)

      THE POSE TEST:
      Before finalizing design, rough sketch these poses:
      [ ] T-pose (base)
      [ ] Walk cycle extreme (max extension)
      [ ] Combat pose (weapon raised)
      [ ] Crouch/roll
      [ ] Jump apex
      [ ] Knocked down

      If any pose breaks the design, redesign before it's too late.
    symptoms:
      - Concept art approved but animators flag issues
      - Hair/cloth clips through body in movement
      - Character looks "weird" from certain angles
      - Proportions seem to change between poses
      - Key poses have muddy silhouettes

  - id: cultural-insensitivity-landmines
    summary: Using cultural elements without understanding, research, or respect
    severity: critical
    situation: Designer uses cultural clothing, symbols, or features as aesthetic without understanding
    why: |
      Harmful stereotypes perpetuate real-world damage. Ignorant design choices can
      be deeply offensive to players from those cultures. This damages your game's
      reputation, alienates players, and contributes to broader cultural harm.
      "I didn't know" is not an excuse for professional designers.
    solution: |
      CULTURAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOL:

      1. RESEARCH BEFORE REFERENCING
         - Learn the history and meaning of elements
         - Understand who uses them and why
         - Know what's sacred vs secular
         - Learn what's been misappropriated before

      2. CONSULT PEOPLE FROM THE CULTURE
         - Not just one person - multiple perspectives
         - Pay cultural consultants for their expertise
         - Listen when they say something is problematic
         - Don't argue or justify - learn

      3. AVOID COMMON TRAPS
         - Religious symbols as "cool" decoration
         - Sacred items as fashion accessories
         - Skin tones as "exotic" or "fantasy races"
         - Stereotypical occupations or behaviors
         - "Tribal" as generic aesthetic
         - Mixing unrelated cultural elements into "ethnic" soup

      4. REPRESENTATION VS APPROPRIATION
         - REPRESENTATION: Character FROM a culture, designed with respect
         - APPROPRIATION: Taking cultural elements for aesthetic without understanding
         - Ask: Is this character or costume?

      5. WHEN DESIGNING FICTIONAL CULTURES
         - Don't map fictional cultures onto real-world stereotypes
         - Avoid "evil race" tropes
         - Give cultures complexity, not caricature

      RED FLAGS TO CHECK:
      [ ] Is this character's culture their only personality trait?
      [ ] Am I using sacred/religious items as decoration?
      [ ] Does this design rely on stereotypes?
      [ ] Would someone from this culture find this offensive?
      [ ] Am I qualified to make this design choice?

      WHEN IN DOUBT:
      - Get expert review before finalizing
      - Be willing to redesign
      - Err on the side of respect
    symptoms:
      - Culture used as costume rather than character depth
      - Design relies on stereotypical visual shorthand
      - Sacred elements used decoratively
      - No cultural consultant credited
      - Defensive response to criticism ("it's just fantasy")

  - id: scale-testing-negligence
    summary: Designing at one resolution without testing at actual game resolutions
    severity: high
    situation: Beautiful concept art at 2000px that becomes unreadable at 64px gameplay size
    why: |
      Players don't see your concept art. They see the character at gameplay resolution,
      often small against a detailed background. A design that only works at concept
      art size has failed its primary purpose - being recognizable during play.
    solution: |
      RESOLUTION-TESTED DESIGN:

      STEP 1: Identify Your Scales
      - MINIMUM: Smallest the character ever appears (icon, minimap)
      - PRIMARY: Most common gameplay view
      - MAXIMUM: Largest appearance (dialogue, close-up)

      STEP 2: Design at Primary Scale
      - Start at the size players see most
      - Don't design at concept art size then shrink
      - Force yourself to work at actual resolution

      STEP 3: Scale Test Protocol
      At MINIMUM scale (icon):
        - Is character identifiable? (silhouette test)
        - Do primary colors read? (color blocking)
        - Is facing direction clear?

      At PRIMARY scale (gameplay):
        - All above plus:
        - Is role/class readable?
        - Can you see basic facial expression?
        - Does character stand out from environment?

      At MAXIMUM scale (close-up):
        - All above plus:
        - Do details reward close viewing?
        - Is there interesting texture/pattern?
        - Does the design hold up to scrutiny?

      STEP 4: Create Scale-Specific Versions
      Don't just scale the same art. Create:
        - Icon version: Simplified for clarity
        - Gameplay version: Optimized for primary camera
        - Portrait version: Added detail for close-ups

      COMMON SCALE FAILURES:
      - Details that blur into noise at small sizes
      - Colors that merge at distance
      - Thin lines that disappear
      - Asymmetry that's invisible when small
    symptoms:
      - Character looks great in art book, wrong in-game
      - Details "disappear" at gameplay resolution
      - Character hard to distinguish from background
      - Design looks different at different zoom levels
      - Players can't tell characters apart during gameplay
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: samey-cast-syndrome
    summary: Multiple characters in game are too visually similar to distinguish
    severity: high
    situation: Line up your characters and they could be costume variations of the same person
    why: |
      If players can't instantly tell characters apart, you've failed basic design
      communication. In gameplay, split-second identification matters. In story,
      confused identities break immersion. Visual diversity isn't just nice - it's
      functional game design.
    solution: |
      THE LINEUP DIFFERENTIATION TEST:

      Create silhouettes of all main characters side by side.
      For EACH character, identify:
      - What makes THIS silhouette unique?
      - Could this be confused with another?
      - What's the ONE thing that identifies them?

      DIFFERENTIATION DIMENSIONS:

      1. BODY TYPE
         - Vary heights
         - Vary widths
         - Vary proportions (head:body ratio)
         - Include different body builds

      2. SILHOUETTE LANDMARKS
         - Each character needs unique landmarks
         - No two characters share the same landmark
         - Hair, accessories, weapons, clothing shapes

      3. COLOR ASSIGNMENT
         - Each character "owns" a primary color
         - Avoid too much overlap in secondary colors
         - Color should identify character even in distance

      4. SHAPE LANGUAGE
         - Vary the dominant shape family
         - Circle character, square character, triangle character
         - Even within a team, shapes should differ

      5. POSTURE AND STANCE
         - Default pose should be unique
         - Body language conveys personality
         - Lineup shouldn't look like clones in different outfits

      DIVERSITY CHECKLIST:
      [ ] At least 2 different body types?
      [ ] Each character has unique silhouette landmark?
      [ ] Each character has unique primary color?
      [ ] Variety in shape language across cast?
      [ ] Could identify each character in 1 second?

      THE "DESCRIBE QUICKLY" TEST:
      For each character, can you describe their look in 3 words?
      If you need the same words for different characters, redesign.
    symptoms:
      - Players confuse characters during gameplay
      - Characters feel like "reskins" of each other
      - Silhouette lineup looks like same person in different costumes
      - No clear visual hierarchy in group shots
      - Characters need names to be distinguished
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: proportion-inconsistency
    summary: Character proportions change unintentionally across different art pieces
    severity: medium
    situation: Same character has different head sizes, limb lengths, or body shapes in different art
    why: |
      Inconsistent proportions make a character feel "off-model" and unprofessional.
      Players notice, even if subconsciously. It breaks immersion and suggests
      lack of quality control. It also makes animation and assets inconsistent.
    solution: |
      PROPORTION DOCUMENTATION:

      CREATE A MODEL SHEET WITH:

      1. HEAD-TO-BODY RATIO
         - How many "heads" tall is the character?
         - Document precisely: "Character is 6.5 heads tall"

      2. KEY MEASUREMENTS
         - Head width = X
         - Shoulder width = Y heads
         - Arm length = Z (from shoulder to wrist)
         - Leg length (hip to ankle)
         - Torso length

      3. PROPORTIONAL GUIDES
         - Draw horizontal lines showing key heights
         - Eye level, chin, shoulders, waist, hip, knee, ankle
         - All art must match these landmarks

      4. OVERLAYS
         - Create a transparent overlay of correct proportions
         - Check all new art against overlay

      COMMON PROPORTION DRIFT:
      - Head grows/shrinks based on art style mood
      - Limbs elongate in action poses and never return
      - Body type changes based on who's drawing
      - "Heroic" poses exaggerate proportions permanently

      STYLE GUIDE ESSENTIALS:
      [ ] Height in "heads" documented
      [ ] Turnaround sheet (front/side/back/3-4)
      [ ] Size comparison with other characters
      [ ] Acceptable stylization range
      [ ] "Do not" examples of common drift

      THE OVERLAY TEST:
      Take new art, overlay the proportion guide.
      Major deviations = fix or reject.
    symptoms:
      - Character "feels different" in different art pieces
      - Animators asking "which version is correct?"
      - Fan art more consistent than official art
      - Character recognition varies by artwork
      - Merchandise looks off
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: readable-but-boring-trap
    summary: Character is technically correct but completely forgettable
    severity: medium
    situation: Design passes all tests but has no soul, no memorable quality, nothing special
    why: |
      Technical proficiency without creativity produces wallpaper characters.
      These designs are "safe" but fail the most important test - does anyone
      actually care about this character? Boring designs don't inspire fan art,
      cosplay, or emotional connection.
    solution: |
      THE "WOULD ANYONE DRAW THIS?" TEST:

      Ask honestly:
      - Would someone choose to draw fan art of this character?
      - Would someone want to cosplay this character?
      - In 10 years, will anyone remember this design?
      - What makes this character DIFFERENT from every similar character?

      ANTI-BORING TECHNIQUES:

      1. THE ONE WEIRD THING
         - Every memorable character has ONE unusual element
         - Mario: Plumber with mushroom powers
         - Sonic: Blue hedgehog with red shoes
         - Give your character ONE unexpected element

      2. PUSH ONE ELEMENT TO EXTREME
         - Take one feature and exaggerate it
         - If eyes are big, make them HUGE
         - If they're strong, make them MASSIVE
         - Commit to something

      3. UNEXPECTED COMBINATION
         - Combine two things that don't usually go together
         - Knight + punk aesthetic
         - Cute animal + menacing color scheme
         - Professional role + unusual visual style

      4. CLEAR OPINION
         - The design should have a point of view
         - Not trying to please everyone
         - Commits to a mood, a style, a statement

      5. THE 2-SECOND PITCH
         - Can you pitch this character in 2 seconds?
         - "A punk rock princess who fights with a guitar"
         - If the pitch is boring, the design is boring

      BORING DESIGN RED FLAGS:
      [ ] Uses only "safe" choices
      [ ] Nothing unexpected or unusual
      [ ] Could describe multiple characters identically
      [ ] No element is pushed to interesting extreme
      [ ] Designer can't articulate what's special
    symptoms:
      - No fan art despite game's popularity
      - Character never mentioned in reviews
      - Players remember gameplay but not characters
      - Design feels "generic" or "by committee"
      - Character seems interchangeable with others
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: backstory-without-visual-support
    summary: Character has rich backstory but design doesn't reflect or communicate it
    why: |
      If the backstory says "veteran warrior with tragic past" but the design says
      "generic person," you've failed visual storytelling. Design IS character
      communication. A well-designed character should hint at their story without
      any text explanation needed.
    severity: medium
    situation: Writer provides detailed character history but design ignores it entirely
    solution: |
      VISUAL STORYTELLING AUDIT:

      For each backstory element, ask:
      "How does the DESIGN show this?"

      EXAMPLE TRANSLATIONS:
      - "Veteran warrior" → scars, worn equipment, confident posture
      - "Former noble" → remnants of fine clothing, signet ring, refined stance
      - "Tragic past" → sad resting expression, memento accessory
      - "Self-taught mage" → improvised equipment, book always present
      - "Survivor" → practical clothing, multiple small weapons

      THE SILENT TEST:
      Show design to someone with NO backstory info.
      What do they assume about the character?
      If assumptions don't match backstory, design has failed.

      STORYTELLING LAYERS:
      1. OBVIOUS (reads instantly)
         - Role/class (armor = fighter, robes = mage)
         - Faction (color/symbol)
         - Threat level (size, weapons)

      2. DISCOVERABLE (rewards attention)
         - Personality (posture, expression, accessories)
         - History hints (scars, wear patterns, kept items)
         - Relationships (matching elements with other characters)

      3. DEEP (for lore hunters)
         - Symbolic elements
         - Cultural references
         - Easter eggs
