    title: DMCA Takedowns Kill Streamer Adoption
    description: >
      Licensed music in your game = muted VODs, deleted videos, banned accounts.
      Streamers will avoid your game entirely if DMCA risk exists.
      One strike can ruin a creator's livelihood.
    detection_pattern: "music|soundtrack|audio|licensed"
    symptoms:
      - Streamers decline keys
      - "Is this DMCA safe?" in every review
      - Muted sections in VODs
    solution: |
      1. Ship with Streamer Mode toggle
      2. Include royalty-free alternative soundtrack
      3. Use StreamBeats, Pretzel, or commission original
      4. Test with actual streamers before launch
      5. CD Projekt RED approach: make ALL audio safe

    title: Stream Sniping Ruins Multiplayer Experiences
    description: >
      Viewers join streamer's games to grief, cheat, or troll.
      Adds 5+ minute stream delay = kills chat interaction.
      Streamers abandon games with sniping problems.
    detection_pattern: "multiplayer|lobby|matchmaking|public"
    symptoms:
      - Streamers complaining about snipers
      - Needing 5-minute stream delay
      - Griefers ruining content
    solution: |
      1. Private lobby support with hidden codes
      2. Delay-reveal lobby system (code shows after game starts)
      3. Anonymous player names option
      4. Invite-only matchmaking
      5. Report and temporary ban system
    technical_detail: >
      Among Us solved this with private rooms and friend codes
      rather than public matchmaking

  - id: ui-unreadable-at-compression
    severity: high
    title: UI Unreadable at 720p/1080p Stream Compression
    description: >
      Twitch compresses to ~6Mbps. YouTube to ~8Mbps. Your beautiful
      12px fonts become blurry blobs. Viewers can't follow gameplay.
    detection_pattern: "font.*size|ui.*text|interface"
    symptoms:
      - Chat asking "what does that say?"
      - Streamers manually explaining UI
      - Important information missed
    solution: |
      1. Minimum 26px font size (Xbox guideline)
      2. High contrast: 4.5:1 ratio minimum, 7:1 optimal
      3. Test at 720p compressed preview
      4. Bold outlines on important text
      5. UI scaling options in settings

  - id: audio-ducking-nightmare
    severity: medium
    title: Game Audio Drowns Out Commentary
    description: >
      Streamers need to be heard. Constant loud game audio forces
      awkward manual volume balancing or inaudible commentary.
    detection_pattern: "voice.*chat|audio|sound|volume"
    symptoms:
      - Streamers manually lowering game volume
      - Commentary hard to hear
      - Viewers complaining in chat
    solution: |
      1. Implement audio ducking (lower game during voice)
      2. Provide separate music/SFX/voice volume sliders
      3. "Commentary mode" preset with lower audio
      4. Don't add extreme audio effects (flashbang, jammer noise)
      5. Test with OBS audio ducking setup
    code_example: |
      // Audio ducking implementation
      const voiceDetector = new VoiceActivityDetector();
      voiceDetector.onSpeechStart = () => {
        gameAudio.volume = 0.3;  // Duck to 30%
      };
      voiceDetector.onSpeechEnd = () => {
        gameAudio.volume = 1.0;  // Restore
      };

  - id: session-length-mismatch
    severity: high
    title: Session Length Doesn't Match Stream Format
    description: >
      Streamers prefer 15-30 minute sessions for variety and clips.
      2-hour sessions mean one game per stream, less exposure,
      and viewer drop-off. Match session to stream format.
    detection_pattern: "session|match|round|game.*length"
    symptoms:
      - Streamers only play once per stream
      - Cutting mid-run to switch games
      - Viewer count drops during long sessions
    solution: |
      1. Design 15-20 minute core loops
      2. Natural break points every 15-20 minutes
      3. Quick restart after death/failure
      4. Satisfying micro-conclusions
      5. "Just one more run" hooks
    examples:
      - Lethal Company: 15-20 minute expeditions
      - Fall Guys: 15-minute shows
      - Among Us: 10-15 minute rounds

  - id: twitch-content-violations
    severity: high
    title: Content Violates Platform Guidelines
    description: >
      Twitch/YouTube have content rules. Sexual content, extreme
      violence, hate symbols can get streamers banned even if
      it's "in the game."
    detection_pattern: "mature|adult|violence|content.*warning"
    symptoms:
      - Streamers refusing to play
      - VODs deleted by platform
      - Bad press about game content
    solution: |
      1. Research platform content guidelines
      2. Content labeling options in-game
      3. "Safe for streaming" mode that disables risky content
      4. Avoid user-generated content without moderation
      5. Historical/contextual violence is usually OK (Wolfenstein)

  - id: obs-game-capture-broken
    severity: medium
    title: OBS Game Capture Doesn't Work
    description: >
      Some games don't work with OBS Game Capture due to anti-cheat,
      DX12 issues, or hooking problems. Streamers forced to use
      less efficient Display Capture.
    detection_pattern: "obs|streaming.*software|capture|directx|dx12"
    symptoms:
      - Black screen in OBS preview
      - Performance issues during streaming
      - Streamers switching to Display Capture
    solution: |
      1. Test with OBS Game Capture before shipping
      2. Provide DX11 fallback option
      3. Check anti-cheat compatibility with OBS
      4. Documentation for streaming setup
      5. Consider Vulkan issues on some systems

  - id: no-emergency-restart
    severity: medium
    title: No Quick Restart After Failures
    description: >
      Stream momentum dies during long restart sequences.
      Loading screens, cutscenes, and menus between attempts
      create dead air that loses viewers.
    detection_pattern: "restart|retry|death|failure"
    symptoms:
      - Awkward silence during restarts
      - Streamers filling time with filler talk
      - Viewers leaving during loading
    solution: |
      1. Instant restart option (skip intro/cutscenes)
      2. Minimal loading between attempts
      3. "Quick restart" keybind
      4. Skip tutorial after first playthrough
      5. Roguelike instant-loop design

  - id: pricing-kills-adoption
    severity: high
    title: Price Too High for Group Purchases
    description: >
      4-player co-op at $30 each = $120 for friend group.
      High friction for impulsive purchases after watching stream.
      Compare to Lethal Company's $10 = $40 for group.
    detection_pattern: "price|cost|purchase"
    symptoms:
      - "I'll wait for a sale" comments
      - Solo play only despite co-op design
      - Low conversion from stream viewers
    solution: |
      1. Sweet spot: $10-15 for streamer games
      2. 4-pack bundle discounts
      3. Free demo for try-before-buy
      4. Launch with 10-15% discount
      5. Among Us model: free base + cosmetics

  - id: no-clip-worthy-moments
    severity: high
    title: Game Has No Clip-Worthy Moments
    description: >
      Streamers need highlight material. If your game produces
      no memorable peaks - jump scares, dramatic reversals,
      comedic deaths - it won't get shared.
    detection_pattern: "clip|highlight|moment|viral"
    symptoms:
      - No game clips on social media
      - Streamers describe game as "chill" (bad for discovery)
      - Low viewer engagement during streams
    solution: |
      1. Design explicit peak moments
      2. Quick tension → release cycles
      3. Unpredictable outcomes for each play
      4. Reaction-worthy revelations
      5. Shareable failure states

  - id: solo-experience-broken
    severity: medium
    title: Solo Play Experience Is Broken/Boring
    description: >
      Content creators are 1% of players. If solo play sucks,
      your Steam reviews will tank from the other 99%.
    detection_pattern: "solo|single.*player|alone"
    symptoms:
      - "Only fun with friends" reviews
      - Low player retention
      - Negative Steam reviews despite streamer success
    solution: |
      1. Design solo-viable core loop
      2. AI companions for co-op designed games
      3. Procedural content for replayability
      4. Single-player-focused progression hooks
      5. Balance for 1-player AND 4-player
