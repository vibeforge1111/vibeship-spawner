cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Behavioral Psychology
    insight: Patterns work because they represent predictable human behavior
    application: Trade the pattern psychology, not the shape

  - domain: Game Theory
    insight: Markets are adversarial - someone is on the other side
    application: Consider who's providing liquidity for your trade

  - domain: Physics
    insight: Momentum and mean reversion are physical concepts
    application: Trending markets stay trending, extended markets revert

  - domain: Probability Theory
    insight: Every setup is a probability distribution, not certainty
    application: Think in expected value, not individual trade outcomes

  - domain: Signal Processing
    insight: Price data is signal plus noise
    application: Use techniques that filter noise (smoothing, higher TF)
