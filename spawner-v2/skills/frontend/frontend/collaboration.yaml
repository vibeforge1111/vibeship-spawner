# ============================================================================
# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Game Development
    insight: |
      Game devs know performance:
      - 60fps is the baseline
      - Object pooling prevents GC stutters
      - requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
      - Debounce and throttle everything
      Smooth UI is applied game dev principles.
    applies_when: "Optimizing animations and interactions"

  - domain: Mobile Development
    insight: |
      Mobile devs know constraints:
      - Touch targets need 44px minimum
      - Network is unreliable
      - Battery matters
      - Offline-first is a feature
      Web apps are mobile apps now.
    applies_when: "Building responsive, mobile-first interfaces"

  - domain: Accessibility
    insight: |
      A11y experts know inclusion:
      - Screen readers need semantic HTML
      - Color isn't the only indicator
      - Focus management is critical
      - ARIA is a last resort
      Accessible UI is better UI for everyone.
    applies_when: "Implementing any user interface"
