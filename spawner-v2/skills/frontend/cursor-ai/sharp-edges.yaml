# Cursor AI Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: rules-file-location
    summary: Rules in wrong location are ignored
    severity: high
    situation: Created rules but AI doesn't follow them
    why: |
      Cursor looks in specific locations.
      .cursorrules must be in project root.
      .cursor/rules/*.mdc for modern split rules.
      Wrong path = silently ignored.
    solution: |
      // Correct rules file locations

      // LEGACY (still works, not recommended)
      project-root/
      └── .cursorrules           # Must be in root

      // MODERN (recommended)

      └── src/.cursorrules       # Wrong - must be in root

      // Verify rules are loaded:
      // Open Cursor, start a chat
      // Rules should appear in context
      // If not, check location and restart Cursor
    symptoms:
      - AI ignores project conventions
      - Rules work locally but not for teammates
      - No error messages about rules

  - id: mdc-glob-patterns
    summary: Wrong glob patterns in .mdc files
    severity: high
    situation: Rules don't apply to expected files
    why: |
      .mdc files use frontmatter with globs.
      Wrong glob = rules never activate.
      No error when glob matches nothing.
    solution: |
      // Correct .mdc frontmatter structure

      // .cursor/rules/testing.mdc

      Your testing rules here...

      // Common glob patterns:
      globs: ["**/*"]                    # All files (use sparingly)
      globs: ["src/**/*.ts"]             # TypeScript in src
      globs: ["**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"]      # Test files
      globs: ["app/api/**/*"]            # API routes
      globs: ["*.config.{js,ts,mjs}"]    # Config files in root

      // WRONG patterns:
      globs: ["*.ts"]        # Only matches root, not subdirs
      globs: ["src/*.ts"]    # Only direct children, not nested
      globs: ["./**/*.ts"]   # Don't use ./ prefix

      // CORRECT patterns:
      globs: ["**/*.ts"]     # All TypeScript files
      globs: ["src/**/*.ts"] # All TypeScript in src tree

      // Multiple patterns:
      globs:
        - "**/*.test.ts"
        - "**/*.spec.ts"
        - "__tests__/**/*"
    symptoms:
      - Rules apply to wrong files
      - Rules never activate
      - Inconsistent AI behavior

  - id: context-token-limits
    summary: Too much context causes truncation
    severity: medium
    situation: AI seems to ignore parts of your prompt or context
    why: |
      Each model has context window limits.
      Large @Codebase or @Folder can fill it.
      Oldest context gets truncated first.
      Your important instructions may be cut.
    solution: |
      // Managing context effectively

      // Check what's in context:
      // Look at the context panel in Cursor
      // Files and rules show token usage

      // PROBLEM: Too much context
      "Add a feature
      @src/            # Includes everything!
      @lib/
      @components/"

      // SOLUTION: Specific references
      "Add a feature
      @src/auth/login.ts
      @src/types/user.ts
      @components/LoginForm.tsx"

      // Use @Codebase for search instead of including all
      "Find authentication patterns
      @Codebase 'jwt token validation'"

      // Reduce rules token usage:
      // Split rules by glob so only relevant ones load
      // .cursor/rules/api.mdc only loads for API files

      // Token-efficient prompts:
      // - Be concise
      // - Reference specific files, not folders
      // - Use rules for persistent context
      // - Paste relevant code snippets, not entire files

      // Model context limits (approximate):
      // Claude Sonnet: 200k tokens
      // GPT-4o: 128k tokens
      // o1: 128k tokens
    symptoms:
      - AI forgets earlier instructions
      - Partial responses
      - "I don't see that file" errors

  - id: background-agent-isolation
    summary: Background agent can't access local state
    severity: medium
    situation: Background agent fails or misses context
    why: |
      Background agents run in isolated environments.
      They don't see uncommitted changes.
      They can't access local env vars.
      They can't ask clarifying questions.
    solution: |
      // Background Agent Requirements

      // 1. Commit your current state first
      git add .
      git commit -m "WIP: save state before background agent"

      // 2. Include all context in the prompt
      // BAD - assumes agent sees your state
      "Continue the auth implementation"

      // GOOD - self-contained prompt
      "Implement Google OAuth login

      Current state:
      - NextAuth is configured in /auth
      - User model has googleId field
      - Environment vars: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_SECRET

      Files to modify:
      - src/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
      - src/lib/auth-options.ts

      Expected outcome:
      - Users can sign in with Google
      - Tests pass
      - PR created"

      // 3. Don't rely on environment variables
      // Background agents have their own env
      // Either:
      // - Use Cursor's secret management
      // - Include mock values for development
      // - Document required env vars in prompt

      // 4. Set clear success criteria
      "Done when:
      - npm run build passes
      - npm run test passes
      - No TypeScript errors
      - PR created with description"
    symptoms:
      - Agent can't find recent files
      - Environment variables undefined
      - Agent asks questions but can't receive answers

  - id: model-mismatch
    summary: Using wrong model for task type
    severity: medium
    situation: Poor results despite good prompts
    why: |
      Different models excel at different tasks.
      Reasoning models (o1) slow but thorough.
      Fast models (Sonnet) quick but may miss nuance.
      Using one for everything is suboptimal.
    solution: |
      // Model Selection Guide

      // PLANNING & ARCHITECTURE
      // Use: o1, o3, Claude Sonnet with extended thinking
      // Why: Need thorough reasoning, trade-offs analysis
      "Plan the database migration strategy..."

      // IMPLEMENTATION
      // Use: Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o
      // Why: Fast, good at code generation
      "Implement the login form component..."

      // CODE REVIEW
      // Use: Claude Sonnet, o1 for security-critical
      // Why: Need thorough analysis
      "Review this authentication code..."

      // DEBUGGING
      // Use: Claude Sonnet with error context
      // Why: Good at pattern matching, fast iteration
      "Fix this error: [paste stack trace]"

      // QUICK EDITS
      // Use: Claude Haiku, GPT-4o-mini
      // Why: Fast, low cost, simple tasks
      "Rename this variable from x to userId"

      // In Cursor settings:
      // Set default model for each mode
      // Or select per-prompt in the UI

      // Plan Mode model selection:
      // Design plan with: reasoning model (o1)
      // Build plan with: fast model (Sonnet)
    symptoms:
      - Slow responses for simple tasks
      - Shallow analysis for complex tasks
      - High token costs

  - id: auto-run-dangers
    summary: Auto-run executes unreviewed commands
    severity: high
    situation: Agent runs destructive commands automatically
    why: |
      Background agents auto-run all terminal commands.
      No approval step like foreground agent.
      Could run rm, git push --force, etc.
    solution: |
      // Safe Auto-Run Configuration

      // 1. Use rules to restrict dangerous commands
      // .cursor/rules/safety.mdc
      ---
      description: Safety rules for agent mode
      globs: ["**/*"]
      ---

      NEVER run these commands without explicit approval:
      - rm -rf
      - git push --force
      - git reset --hard
      - DROP TABLE / DELETE FROM
      - npm publish
      - Any command with sudo

      Always run in dry-run mode first:
      - npm publish --dry-run
      - prisma migrate deploy --dry-run

      // 2. For Background Agents, be explicit
      "Implement feature X

      Allowed commands:
      - npm install
      - npm run build
      - npm run test
      - git commit
      - git push (to feature branch only)

      NOT allowed:
      - npm publish
      - Any force operations
      - Modifying main branch"

      // 3. Review agent actions after completion
      // Check git log for what was committed
      // Review any PRs before merging
      // Check for unintended side effects
    symptoms:
      - Unexpected deletions
      - Force pushes
      - Published packages
