# Brand Positioning Sharp Edges
# Positioning mistakes that doom brands to mediocrity or death

sharp_edges:
  - id: something-for-everyone
    summary: Positioning that tries to appeal to everyone
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Our brand appeals to everyone who needs [broad category]."
      Positioning tries to be universally appealing. Avoiding strong stances.
      Messaging is generic and forgettable.
    why: |
      When you position for everyone, you resonate with no one. Generic positioning
      is invisible. "Liking" doesn't mean buying or remembering. You become
      interchangeable with every competitor. No mental real estate captured.
    solution: |
      Positioning is about sacrifice. Define who you're NOT for.

      # The tighter the position, the more magnetic:
      VOLVO doesn't say "we make good cars"
      → They own "safety"
      → They sacrificed "sporty," "luxury," "economical"
      → To own ONE word

      # Position specificity test:
      □ Can you complete: "We're the only X that Y"?
      □ Does messaging exclude some people?
      □ Would competitors reject your position?
      □ Is target psychographic, not just demographic?
    symptoms:
      - Uses words like "innovative," "quality," "best-in-class"
      - Target audience is demographic only
      - Can't complete "We're the only X that Y"
      - Messaging could apply to any competitor
    detection_pattern: 'innovative|best-in-class|quality solutions|leading provider'

  - id: feature-as-position
    summary: Positioning on a feature competitors can copy
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We're positioned as the fastest/cheapest/most feature-rich."
      Position based on temporary technical advantage, not defensible mental space.
    why: |
      Features can be copied tomorrow. When competitor matches you, position evaporates.
      You're in a features arms race you can't win. No emotional or identity component.
    solution: |
      Features support positions; they don't create them.

      # Apple isn't positioned on specs:
      Positioned on: "Think different" and design elegance
      Specs: Support that story, not define it

      # Defensible positions:
      - Heritage/origin story
      - Philosophy/worldview
      - Audience you serve
      - Category you defined

      # Test:
      "If competitor copies features, does position remain?"
      If no → position is weak
    symptoms:
      - Positioning statement leads with feature
      - Competitor could make same claim
      - Position invalidated by competitor's update
      - No emotional or identity component

  - id: category-prisoner
    summary: Accepting existing category definitions and fighting within them
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You're "another CRM" or "another project management tool."
      Fighting for share of a pie others defined. Incremental differentiation only.
    why: |
      You can't be #1 in a category someone else owns. You're always playing catch-up.
      Fighting on competitor's terms. The established player has brand, distribution,
      network effects you'll never overcome.
    solution: |
      If you can't be #1 or #2, create a new category.

      # Category creation examples:
      Salesforce: Not "enterprise software" → "cloud CRM"
      Drift: Not "live chat" → "conversational marketing"
      HubSpot: Not "marketing tools" → "inbound marketing"

      # Category design questions:
      - What are we fundamentally different at?
      - What dimension do we win on?
      - Can we define new buying criteria?
      - What's the inevitable trend we ride?
    symptoms:
      - Described as "X, but better"
      - Competing in established analyst category
      - Differentiation is incremental
      - Fighting on competitor's terms

  - id: internal-positioning-delusion
    summary: Positioning created in conference rooms without customer input
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Positioning reflects what executives want to be, not what customers believe.
      Massive gap between brand aspiration and market perception.
    why: |
      Your positioning must be grounded in customer truth. If customers don't already
      feel it, you can't convince them. Positioning exercises without customers create
      groupthink. Internal consensus doesn't equal market reality.
    solution: |
      Ground positioning in customer language.

      # Customer research:
      Interview 20+ customers about why they chose you
      Use THEIR words, not yours
      Listen for mental categories they put you in

      # Positioning should articulate what customers already feel:
      Not: Convince them of something new
      But: Name what they already experience

      # Questions:
      "Why did you choose us?"
      "How would you describe us to a friend?"
      "What would you miss if we disappeared?"
    symptoms:
      - Positioning created without customer research
      - Customers describe brand differently than materials
      - High disconnect between promise and reviews
      - Positioning feels aspirational rather than actual

  - id: repositioning-whiplash
    summary: Changing positioning every 1-2 years
    severity: high
    situation: |
      New CMO, new agency, new position. Brand changes direction constantly.
      Market never forms a clear impression because the story keeps changing.
    why: |
      Positioning takes 5-10 years to cement. Every change resets the clock.
      Customers get confused about "what you stand for." Brand equity never builds.
      You're always introducing yourself instead of reinforcing yourself.
    solution: |
      Commit and defend through multiple cycles.

      # BMW: "The Ultimate Driving Machine" since 1975
      # Volvo: "Safety" for decades
      # Apple: "Think Different" evolved but consistent

      # Repositioning rules:
      - Change execution, not position
      - Defend through leadership changes
      - Defend through economic cycles
      - Position evolution ≠ position change

      # When to actually reposition:
      - Category fundamentally changed
      - Company fundamentally changed
      - Current position genuinely wrong
      NOT: New CMO wants to make their mark
    symptoms:
      - Different taglines across brand assets
      - Positioning changes with leadership
      - Agency changeover triggers repositioning
      - Customers confused about what you stand for

  - id: functional-only-position
    summary: Positioning entirely on rational benefits, ignoring emotion
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Position is all rational: speeds, feeds, features, price.
      No emotional or identity dimensions considered.
    why: |
      Even B2B buyers are humans. They care about looking good to their boss,
      reducing career risk, feeling smart. Purely rational positions are cold
      and interchangeable.
    solution: |
      Add emotional and identity layers.

      # IBM: "Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"
      # That's emotional positioning disguised as functional

      # Emotional dimensions:
      - How does choosing you make them feel?
      - How does it affect their status?
      - What does it say about them?
      - What risk does it reduce?

      # Position layers:
      Functional: What you do
      Emotional: How it feels
      Identity: What it says about them
      Social: How others perceive them
    symptoms:
      - Positioning has no emotional element
      - All proof points are rational/quantitative
      - No sense of what customer becomes
      - Brand feels cold or interchangeable

  - id: commodity-spiral
    summary: Competing primarily on price with no differentiation
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      You're the "cheap option." Customers trained on price.
      No margin, no loyalty. They leave for the next cheaper option.
    why: |
      Price is the last refuge of the undifferentiated. No margin means no
      reinvestment. Customers attracted by price are the least loyal.
      You're in a race to the bottom you can't win.
    solution: |
      Find any other dimension to compete on.

      # Southwest: Not just cheap
      → Personality and simplicity
      → Fun brand voice
      → No-hassle experience

      # Dollar Shave Club: Not just cheap
      → Convenience and irreverence
      → Direct relationship
      → Subscription model innovation

      # If you must be low-price:
      Position as philosophy: "Democratizing access"
      Not desperation: "We're cheaper"
    symptoms:
      - Primary message is price or discount
      - No answer to "why choose you at same price?"
      - Customers describe you as "the cheap one"
      - Margin pressure year over year

  - id: borrowed-interest-position
    summary: Positioning that relies on trends that will pass
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Position relies on a trend, celebrity, or cultural moment not intrinsic to brand.
      When the trend passes, the position evaporates.
    why: |
      Trends are borrowed attention, not owned equity. When the trend passes,
      you're left with nothing. You haven't built anything durable. Position
      feels dated within years.
    solution: |
      Build on enduring truths about your customer.

      # Trends can amplify, not define:
      Good: Use trend to express existing position
      Bad: Let trend become your position

      # Test:
      "If we removed the trend, would position still make sense?"
      If no → you don't have a position

      # Enduring truths:
      - Human needs that persist
      - Category truths that won't change
      - Customer aspirations
      - Problems that will always exist
    symptoms:
      - Positioning relies heavily on current trend
      - Would feel dated in 3 years
      - Connection to trend is superficial
      - Underlying brand truth unclear

  - id: literal-positioning
    summary: Positioning that describes what you do instead of what you mean
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      "We help businesses manage their customer data."
      Position describes function, not meaning. Dictionary definition, not story.
    why: |
      Literal positioning is forgettable in 5 seconds. No mental picture.
      No emotional response. Describes category, not unique meaning.
      Could apply to dozens of competitors.
    solution: |
      Find the metaphor or transformation.

      # Apple iPod:
      Literal: "5GB MP3 player"
      Meaningful: "1,000 songs in your pocket"

      # Apple:
      Literal: "Computers for creative professionals"
      Meaningful: "Think different"

      # Position should create:
      - Mental picture
      - Emotional response
      - Transformation story
      - Memorable phrase
    symptoms:
      - Positioning reads like a dictionary definition
      - No metaphor or transformation language
      - Describes category, not unique meaning
      - Forgettable in 5 seconds

  - id: positioning-execution-gap
    summary: Positioning says one thing, product/experience says another
    severity: high
    situation: |
      You claim "premium" but UX is clunky. You claim "simple" but require
      12-step onboarding. Gap between promise and delivery.
    why: |
      Every touchpoint either reinforces or contradicts position. Contradictions
      destroy trust. Customers remember the experience, not the claim.
      One bad touchpoint negates ten good messages.
    solution: |
      Position must be true today, not aspirational.

      # Every touchpoint must reinforce:
      If you position on "simple":
      - Website must be simple
      - Onboarding must be simple
      - Billing page must be simple
      - Support must be simple

      # Create a "position guard":
      Someone who rejects anything contradicting position
      Review every touchpoint against position
      Fix execution gaps before messaging gaps
    symptoms:
      - Customer complaints contradict positioning
      - Product team unfamiliar with brand position
      - Touchpoints designed without positioning input
      - NPS comments don't reflect desired position

  - id: differentiation-that-doesnt-matter
    summary: Being unique on a dimension customers don't care about
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We're the only CRM built on Rust!" Cool, but customers don't value that.
      Differentiation is real but irrelevant.
    why: |
      Differentiation must be on a dimension customers care about and would pay for.
      Being unique doesn't matter if uniqueness isn't valued. Technical differences
      feel significant internally but invisible externally.
    solution: |
      Use the "So what?" test.

      # Keep asking until you reach customer benefit:
      "Built on Rust" → So what?
      "Faster" → So what?
      "Less waiting" → So what?
      "More doing, less frustration" → THERE'S the position

      # Validate differentiation:
      - Does it appear in buying criteria?
      - Would customers pay more for it?
      - Do they mention it in reviews?
      - Can you prove they care?
    symptoms:
      - Differentiation is technical or internal
      - '\"So what?\" can''t be answered in customer terms'
      - Unique claim doesn't appear in buying criteria
      - Customers unimpressed by differentiator

  - id: heritage-hostage
    summary: Trapped by historical positioning that no longer resonates
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      "We've always been the X company." Even when market has moved.
      Clinging to historical positioning that no longer connects.
    why: |
      Markets evolve. Customer needs change. Competitors redefine categories.
      Historical position that was once winning can become irrelevant.
      Brand equity in something no one values anymore.
    solution: |
      Honor heritage but don't be imprisoned.

      # Apple evolution:
      "Computers for creatives"
      → "The intersection of technology and liberal arts"
      → "Empowering everyone to create"

      # The thread is there, but it evolved

      # Evolution questions:
      - What's the core truth that persists?
      - How does that truth apply to today's market?
      - What's the modern expression?
      - How do younger customers relate?
    symptoms:
      - Positioning unchanged for 10+ years despite market shifts
      - Younger customers don't relate
      - Heritage celebrated but not evolved
      - Relevance declining in core metrics
