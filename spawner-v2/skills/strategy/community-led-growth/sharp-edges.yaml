  - id: ghost-town-community
    summary: Launching community that sits empty
    severity: high
    situation: Community exists but nobody engages
    why: |
      Launched before critical mass.
      No seeding strategy.
      Members don't see value in participating.
    solution: |
      ## Preventing Ghost Town Communities

      ### Pre-Launch Requirements

      **Critical Mass Calculation**
      ```
      For active community:
      - 10% of members post monthly
      - Need 5+ posts/day for engagement feel

      Minimum members = 5 posts × 30 days / 10% = 1,500 members
      Or: Seed 50 posts/week manually until organic
      ```

      ### Seeding Strategies

      **1. Founding Member Program**
      - Recruit 50-100 engaged users first
      - Private beta before public launch
      - Create content backlog
      - Establish norms and culture

      **2. Content Seeding**
      ```
      Before launch:
      - 30+ discussion threads
      - 10+ resource posts
      - 5+ pinned welcome content
      - Responding activity visible
      ```

      **3. Event-Driven Launch**
      - Launch at/around event
      - Immediate activity from attendees
      - Momentum from day one

      ### Recovery Playbook

      If already ghost town:
      1. Don't delete - looks like failure
      2. Soft-relaunch with founding program
      3. Dramatically increase seeded activity
      4. Consider platform pivot if audience mismatch

      ### Health Thresholds

      | Metric | Healthy | At Risk | Ghost Town |
      |--------|---------|---------|------------|
      | Posts/day | 5+ | 1-5 | <1 |
      | Response rate | >50% | 20-50% | <20% |
      | Active members | >10% | 5-10% | <5% |
    symptoms:
      - New posts get no responses
      - Same 3 people post everything
      - Weeks between activities

      ## Preventing Ambassador Burnout

      ### Warning Signs

      - Declining activity from top contributors
      - Complaints about workload
      - Ghosting on commitments
      - Negative sentiment in feedback

      ### Prevention Framework

      **1. Set Clear Expectations**
      ```
      Ambassador agreement includes:
      - Maximum hours/month expected
      - Types of activities
      - How to say no
      - Break/sabbatical policy
      ```

      **2. Rotate Responsibilities**
      ```
      Month 1: Ambassador A leads events
      Month 2: Ambassador A does content, B leads events
      Month 3: Ambassador A rests, B does content
      ```

      **3. Scale the Load**
      ```
      When community grows:
      - Add more ambassadors (not more work per person)
      - Automate repetitive tasks
      - Create self-serve resources
      ```

      **4. Recognition Matching Effort**

      | Effort Level | Recognition |
      |--------------|-------------|
      | Light (2-4 hrs/mo) | Swag, early access |
      | Medium (8-12 hrs/mo) | Above + stipend, events |
      | Heavy (20+ hrs/mo) | Above + compensation, advisory role |

      ### Burnout Recovery

      1. Acknowledge and thank
      2. Offer break without judgment
      3. Reduce scope when they return
      4. Add capacity to team

      ### Healthy Program Metrics

      | Metric | Target |
      |--------|--------|
      | Ambassador tenure | >12 months avg |
      | Churn rate | <25% annually |
      | NPS of ambassadors | >50 |
      | Workload spread | No one >25% of output |
    symptoms:
      - Top contributors going quiet
      - Declining commitment fulfillment
      - Complaints in feedback sessions

      Friction too high.
      Features don't support use case.
    solution: |
      ## Platform-Audience Fit

      ### Audience Analysis

      **Developer/Technical Audience**
      - Prefer: Discord, GitHub Discussions, Discourse
      - Avoid: Facebook, LinkedIn groups
      - Why: Technical features, code formatting, integrations

      **Business/Marketing Audience**
      - Prefer: Slack, Circle, LinkedIn

      - Why: Professional feel, familiar interface

      **Consumer/General Audience**
      - Prefer: Facebook, Discord, Reddit
      - Avoid: Enterprise platforms
      - Why: Where they already are

      ### Platform Selection Matrix

      | Need | Forum (Discourse) | Chat (Discord) | Social (Circle) |
      |------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
      | Long-form discussion | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
      | Real-time chat | ✗ | ✓✓✓ | ✓ |

      ### Migration Decision

      Migrate when:
      - Engagement consistently <20% of expected
      - User feedback strongly negative
      - Business needs changed
      - Current platform limiting growth

      Don't migrate when:
      - Just "grass is greener"
      - No clear user demand
      - Migration cost > benefit
    symptoms:
      - Users complain about platform
      - Low signup-to-active ratio
      - Alternative communities forming elsewhere

  - id: scaling-too-fast
    summary: Growing community beyond management capacity
    severity: medium
    situation: Quality drops as community grows
    why: |
      Moderation can't keep up.
      Culture diluted.
      Signal-to-noise ratio drops.
    solution: |
      ## Controlled Community Scaling

      ### Scaling Thresholds

      | Members | Team Needed | Focus |
      |---------|-------------|-------|
      | 0-500 | 0.5 FTE | Culture, founding members |
      | 500-2000 | 1 FTE | Structure, programs |
      | 2000-10000 | 2-3 FTE | Moderation, automation |
      | 10000+ | 3-5+ FTE | Sub-communities, delegation |

      ### Quality Control at Scale

      **1. Moderation Scaling**
      ```
      Early: Founder/team moderates
      Growth: Add volunteer moderators
      Scale: Moderation tools + volunteers + staff
      ```

      **2. Culture Documentation**
      ```
      Create and enforce:
      - Community guidelines
      - Quality standards
      - Escalation paths
      - Recognition of good behavior
      ```

      **3. Sub-Community Structure**

      ├── Beginner zone
      ├── Advanced users
      ├── Regional groups
      └── Topic-specific
      ```

      ### Growth Gates

      **Consider gating when:**
      - Moderation backlog growing
      - Quality complaints increasing
      - Core members disengaging

      - Invite-only periods
      - Qualification requirements
      - Waitlist
    symptoms:
      - Quality complaints from long-time members
      - Moderation team overwhelmed
      - Core contributors leaving
