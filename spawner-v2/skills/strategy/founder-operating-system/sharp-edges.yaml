# Founder Operating System Sharp Edges
# The productivity traps that waste founder time

sharp_edges:
  - id: calendar-fragmentation
    summary: Meetings scattered throughout day destroying deep work
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Six meetings spread across the day. Each one hour. But entire day is
      gone. No deep work possible. Evening spent catching up on real work.
      Burnout building.
    why: |
      Makers need uninterrupted blocks. A single meeting can destroy an
      entire morning of productive work. Context switching is expensive.
      Calendar fragments, productivity crumbles.
    solution: |
      Calendar protection:

      1. Block mornings for maker work - no exceptions
      2. Batch all meetings in afternoon blocks
      3. Meeting-free days if possible (2 per week)
      4. Default to 25 or 50 minute meetings

      Protect time like you protect money. It is more valuable.
    symptoms:
      - Meetings scattered throughout day
      - Never more than 2 hours uninterrupted
      - Real work done evenings and weekends
      - Constant context switching

  - id: runway-denial
    summary: Not knowing or facing default alive vs dead status
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Runway is 8 months. But have not calculated months to profitability.
      Assume fundraising will happen. Actually default dead. By the time
      realized, options have narrowed.
    why: |
      Default alive vs dead determines what actions are appropriate. If
      default dead, need urgent action: cut burn, accelerate revenue, or
      raise now. Not knowing is dangerous.
    solution: |
      Monthly calculation:

      Current burn: $X/month
      Current revenue: $Y/month
      Growth rate: Z%/month
      Months to profitability at this trajectory: N
      Runway remaining: M months

      If M < N: DEFAULT DEAD - take action now
      If M > N: DEFAULT ALIVE - can focus on growth
    symptoms:
      - Do not know runway precisely
      - Have not calculated path to profitability
      - Vague hope about fundraising
      - Surprised by cash crunch

  - id: thousand-cuts
    summary: Gradual burn creep from small decisions
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Burn was 50K. Now 120K. Cannot explain where it went. Each decision
      was small. Better office. One more tool. Slightly higher salary.
      Death by a thousand cuts.
    why: |
      Big decisions get scrutiny. Small decisions slide through. Together
      they kill. Every small increase is another month off runway.
    solution: |
      Weekly small decision review:

      What got added this week?
      What increased even slightly?
      What could we remove without impact?

      Zero-based thinking monthly:
      If starting from zero, would we spend this?
    symptoms:
      - Burn increased without clear reason
      - Many small subscriptions
      - Gradual lifestyle creep
      - No review of small expenses

  - id: verbal-only-decisions
    summary: Important decisions made verbally with no documentation
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Strategy discussed in meeting. Everyone nods. Month later, different
      recollections. No alignment. Same debates repeat. History lost.
    why: |
      Writing forces clarity. Verbal decisions remain fuzzy. Documentation
      creates alignment and history. Decisions that are not written down
      are decisions that will be forgotten or reinterpreted.
    solution: |
      Write it down:

      After important decisions:
      - What did we decide?
      - Why?
      - What are the implications?

      Shared document everyone can reference.
      Prevents endless re-litigation.
    symptoms:
      - Decisions only in meetings
      - Different recollections later
      - Same debates recurring
      - No decision log

  - id: constant-direction-change
    summary: Changing strategy with every new input
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Investor says try X. Do X. Advisor says try Y. Do Y. Customer says Z.
      Do Z. Team whiplash. Nothing executes. Nothing compounds.
    why: |
      New input is constant. If every input changes direction, nothing gets
      done. Strong opinions loosely held means having conviction while
      remaining open to significant evidence. Not changing with every input.
    solution: |
      Input integration process:

      When receiving new input:
      1. Thank them for the input
      2. Note it for consideration
      3. Do NOT commit to change immediately
      4. Evaluate against existing strategy
      5. Only change if evidence is substantial

      Commit to direction. Update only with significant reason.
    symptoms:
      - New direction after every conversation
      - Team confused on strategy
      - Lack of commitment to direction
      - Nothing executes long enough

  - id: no-reflection-time
    summary: All execution, no thinking time
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Every minute scheduled. Always doing. Never thinking. Strategic
      decisions made on the fly. No time to process learnings. Busy but
      not effective.
    why: |
      Reflection is not luxury. It is essential. Processing what happened.
      Planning what is next. Writing to clarify thinking. Without it,
      you are reacting, not leading.
    solution: |
      Schedule thinking time:

      Daily: 30 min morning planning, evening review
      Weekly: 2 hours strategy thinking (no input, just thinking)
      Monthly: Half day reflection on learnings

      Protect this time like important meetings.
    symptoms:
      - No unscheduled time
      - Reactive decision making
      - No time to think strategically
      - Always in execution mode

  - id: meeting-as-default
    summary: Defaulting to meetings instead of async communication
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Every question becomes a meeting. Calendar is full. Simple things
      take hours to resolve because everyone needs to be present.
    why: |
      Most things do not need meetings. Async communication is often
      faster and leaves documentation. Meetings should be for decisions
      that need real-time discussion, not information sharing.
    solution: |
      Meeting decision tree:

      Is this information sharing? Send an email.
      Is this a simple question? Slack message.
      Does this need real-time discussion? Maybe a meeting.
      Does this need in-person energy? Yes, meeting.

      Default to async. Meeting is the exception.
    symptoms:
      - Meetings for everything
      - Information shared in meetings only
      - Calendar completely full
      - Simple things require meetings

  - id: email-inbox-living
    summary: Living in email inbox reacting to whatever arrives
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Day starts with email. Ends with email. Respond to whatever is
      loudest. No proactive work. Other people set the agenda through
      what they send.
    why: |
      Email is other people agenda. Living in inbox means doing what
      others want, not what is important. Check email, do not live in it.
    solution: |
      Email batching:

      Check email 2-3 times per day
      Not first thing in morning
      Process to empty, do not leave half-read
      Between checks, work on priorities

      Your agenda, not your inbox, should drive your day.
    symptoms:
      - Email open all day
      - Reactive to incoming
      - No proactive priorities
      - Other people setting agenda

  - id: delegation-failure
    summary: Doing everything yourself instead of building team capability
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Founder does everything. No one else can do it right. Everything
      runs through founder. Bottleneck forms. Cannot scale. Burnout.
    why: |
      Early stage requires founders to do everything. But it must evolve.
      Doing it yourself does not build team. Teaching others does.
      Short-term slower, long-term faster.
    solution: |
      Delegation development:

      1. Do it yourself first (learn it)
      2. Document how you do it
      3. Teach someone else
      4. Let them do it (imperfectly at first)
      5. Coach improvement
      6. Step away

      Build the team, not just the product.
    symptoms:
      - Everything runs through founder
      - Team cannot act independently
      - Founder burnout building
      - Bottleneck at founder

  - id: no-writing-practice
    summary: Never writing to clarify and share thinking
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Thinking stays in head. Never written. Ideas fuzzy. Team unclear
      on strategy. Investors unsure what is happening. Communication gaps
      everywhere.
    why: |
      Writing is thinking. Unclear writing reveals unclear thinking. Regular
      writing forces clarity, creates documentation, enables sharing.
      Founders should write regularly.
    solution: |
      Regular writing practice:

      Weekly: Investor update or internal memo
      Monthly: Reflection on learnings
      Quarterly: Strategic review

      Publish when appropriate. Accountability helps.
    symptoms:
      - Rarely write anything
      - Thinking stays fuzzy
      - Team unclear on strategy
      - No documentation of thinking
