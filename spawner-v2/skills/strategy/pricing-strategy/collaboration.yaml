        - Users seem happy on free forever

        PRICING ANALYSIS:

        DIAGNOSIS: Free tier too good + gap too large

        ISSUES:
        1. 5 users is enough for most small teams
        2. $0 to $49 is a big psychological jump
        3. No forcing function to upgrade

        RECOMMENDATIONS:
        A. Reduce free tier limits:
           - 3 users (not 5)
           - 100MB storage (not 1GB)
           - No API access

        B. Add intermediate tier:
           - $19/mo Starter (5 users, 1GB)
           - $49/mo Team (unlimited users)
           - Creates stepping stone

        C. Usage-based forcing function:
           - Free trial of 14 days
           - Then feature limits kick in
           - "Upgrade to continue" moment
