    summary: Pouring resources into acquisition before product-market fit
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Raise money, hire growth team, pour resources into acquisition.
      Users come in, churn right out. Spending faster than learning.
      By the time you realize PMF isn't there, runway is burned.
    why: |
      Growth amplifies what you have. Leaky bucket fills faster—and empties faster.
      You're accelerating failure. Every dollar spent acquiring users who churn
      is wasted. You learn nothing except how to lose money.
    solution: |
      # Focus on retention before acquisition:
      Growth without retention is waste

      # Sean Ellis test:
      "Would 40%+ of users be very disappointed
       if they could no longer use the product?"
      Until YES, don't scale growth.

      # PMF signals to hit first:
      - Month 1 retention >40% (B2C) or >80% (B2B)
      - Cohort curves flatten (not decline to zero)
      - Organic word-of-mouth happening
      - Users expanding usage unprompted

      # Then and only then: Scale growth
    symptoms:
      - Month 1 retention below 40% (B2C) or 80% (B2B)
      - Cohort curves don't flatten
      - CAC increasing while retention flat
      - Growth team hired before retention metrics solid

  - id: paid-acquisition-addiction
    summary: Dependency on paid acquisition with deteriorating economics
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Paid acquisition works initially. Scale it. CAC increases as you exhaust
      early audiences. Now dependent on paid, but economics don't work.
      Can't turn it off because growth stops. Treadmill speeding up.
    why: |
      Paid is predictable but expensive. CAC trends up as you exhaust cheap audiences.
      No organic foundation means zero growth when paid stops. You're renting customers,
      not building a business.
    solution: |
      # Paid should be frosting, not the cake:
      Build organic growth loops first
      Use paid to accelerate proven loops
      Not replace them

      # Healthy metrics:
      - LTV:CAC of 3:1 or better
      - Payback under 12 months
      - <40% of acquisition from paid
      - Organic growth when paid turned off

      # Plan to reduce paid:
      Paid % of acquisition should decline over time
      As organic loops compound

      # If addicted:
      Systematically build organic channels
      Accept temporary growth slowdown
      Better than death spiral
    symptoms:
      - '">70% of acquisition from paid"'
      - CAC trending up quarter over quarter
      - No organic growth when paid turned off
      - '"LTV:CAC below 3:1"'

  - id: leaky-bucket-acceleration
    summary: Celebrating acquisition while ignoring activation and retention
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Celebrating growing signups. But activated users and retained users
      aren't growing at same rate. Funnel leaks more than it holds.
      Acquiring users just to lose them.
    why: |
      Acquisition metrics are visible and celebrated. Churn is diffuse and delayed.
      Nobody gets promoted for "we slowed down churn." But filling a leaky bucket
      is useless work.
    solution: |
      # Fix the bucket before filling faster:
      Map your full funnel:
      Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral

      # Find the biggest leak:
      Where do most users fall off?
      Fix that before optimizing acquisition

      # Often the best "growth" work is retention work:
      10% improvement in retention > 10% more acquisition
      Retention compounds, acquisition doesn't

      # Funnel health check:
      Activation rate: >30%
      D1 retention: >25%
      D7 retention: >10%
      D30 retention: >5%
      (B2C; B2B should be higher)
    symptoms:
      - Signup growth >> active user growth
      - Activation rate below 30%
      - D1/D7/D30 retention declining
      - '"More top of funnel" as solution to everything'

  - id: single-channel-dependency
    summary: Relying on one channel for majority of growth
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Find a channel that works - SEO, Facebook ads, partnerships.
      Double down. Becomes 80%+ of growth. Then it changes:
      algorithm update, policy change, market saturation. Growth collapses.
    why: |
      Every channel saturates or gets disrupted. Algorithm changes happen.
      Policies change. Competition increases. Single channel dependency is
      existential risk.
    solution: |
      # Diversification rules:
      No single channel >40% of sustainable acquisition
      Actively invest in 2-3 channels
      Build at least one owned channel (email, community)

      # Even when one dominates:
      Keep investing in alternatives
      New channels require time to mature
      Can't start from zero when main channel dies

      # Owned channels are insurance:
      Email list you own
      Community you control
      Direct relationships
    symptoms:
      - One channel >50% of acquisition
      - Channel concentration increasing
      - No active experimentation in new channels
      - Panic when channel performance drops

  - id: vanity-metrics-celebration
    summary: Measuring noise instead of signal
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Dashboards show hockey sticks: downloads, signups, page views, followers.
      Boards are impressed. But revenue is flat, retention is poor,
      engagement is shallow.
    why: |
      Vanity metrics go up and to the right but don't indicate business health.
      They're easy to move and make good press releases. Real metrics are
      harder and often embarrassing.
    solution: |
      # Define your OMTM (One Metric That Matters):
      Usually: Weekly active users doing the core action
      Or: Monthly retention rate
      Or: Monthly recurring revenue

      # Test your metrics:
      "If this metric doubled, would the business double?"
      If not, it's vanity.

      # Metric hierarchy:
      Tier 1: Revenue, retention, profit
      Tier 2: Activation, engagement depth
      Tier 3: Signups, traffic, followers

      # Focus on Tier 1. Tier 3 is context, not success.
    symptoms:
      - Celebrating downloads/signups as wins
      - No cohort-based retention analysis
      - Revenue not tracking with user metrics
      - Metrics gamed for board presentations

  - id: referral-program-silver-bullet
    summary: Expecting referral program to create organic referrals that don't exist
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Dropbox grew with referrals, let's add a referral program!"
      Build it, offer incentives, announce it. Nothing happens.
      Product isn't referral-worthy. Incentives don't change that.
    why: |
      Referral programs amplify existing referral behavior; they don't create it.
      If users aren't referring organically, incentives won't help.
      The problem is the product, not the program.
    solution: |
      # First question:
      "Do users tell others about us without incentives?"

      If NO: Fix the product
      - Make it remarkable
      - Create share-worthy moments
      - Build in natural sharing

      If YES: Then referral program can accelerate
      - Reduce friction
      - Add small incentive
      - Track and optimize

      # Referral program design:
      - Two-sided incentives (both parties benefit)
      - Gate rewards behind activation, not signup
      - Monitor for fraud patterns
      - Measure referred user quality
    symptoms:
      - Referral program launched without organic referral data
      - High incentives (desperation sign)
      - Low redemption rate
      - Referred users churn faster than organic

  - id: growth-hack-obsession
    summary: Chasing viral tricks instead of building sustainable systems
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Chase "growth hacks" - viral videos, influencer stunts, gamification tricks.
      Some work briefly. Nothing compounds. Constantly searching for the next hack
      instead of building sustainable systems.
    why: |
      Growth hacks are lottery tickets. Occasionally win big, usually nothing.
      No compounding. You're always starting over. Meanwhile, competitors
      build systems that compound.
    solution: |
      # Growth hacks = lottery tickets
      # Growth systems = retirement accounts

      # Build loops that compound:
      User creates content
      → Content gets indexed
      → Search brings users
      → Users create content
      Each cycle strengthens the next.

      # System examples:
      - Content/SEO loop
      - Referral loop
      - UGC loop
      - Marketplace loop

      # Sustainable > Viral:
      10% monthly compound > occasional spike
      Unsexy but wins
    symptoms:
      - Growth tactics but no growth strategy
      - Success not repeatable
      - Constant search for "what's next"
      - No compounding over time

  - id: monetization-later-trap
    summary: Growing free users without validating willingness to pay
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Grow users aggressively, assuming monetization will follow.
      When you introduce pricing, users revolt or churn.
      Trained them to expect free. Or attracted users who can't/won't pay.
    why: |
      Users attracted by "free" are different from users willing to pay.
      You've built an audience that doesn't match your business model.
      Monetization becomes painful instead of natural.
    solution: |
      # Build monetization into growth strategy from start:
      Know who will pay and why
      Ideally, monetize early to validate willingness

      # What matters:
      Growth of paying users > Growth of free users

      # Healthy free-to-paid:
      - Free tier adds value to paid (network effects)
      - Clear upgrade path
      - Paying users from day one
      - Unit economics work

      # Dangerous free:
      - No paying customers after months
      - "We'll monetize when we hit X users"
      - Assuming free users convert
    symptoms:
      - Metrics focus on users, not revenue
      - No paying customer segment defined
      - Pricing discussions deferred
      - "We'll monetize when we hit X users"

  - id: network-effects-mirage
    summary: Claiming network effects that don't actually exist
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Believe you have network effects because "more users make the product better."
      But you don't have true network effects—you have scale effects or
      content aggregation. When growth slows, no self-reinforcing loop.
    why: |
      "Network effects" sounds good to investors. But scale effects are different.
      True network effects create winner-take-all dynamics. Without them,
      competitors easily replicate at scale.
    solution: |
      # True network effects test:
      Each user DIRECTLY increases value for other users
      More friends on Facebook makes Facebook better FOR YOU

      # Test:
      "If you lose 20% of users, does value drop more than 20%?"
      If NO → you don't have network effects
      You have scale economies (different, weaker)

      # Types of "moats":
      Network effects (exponential defensibility)
      Scale effects (linear defensibility)
      Content aggregation (no defensibility)

      # Be honest about which you have
    symptoms:
      - Claiming network effects without demonstrating them
      - Value comes from content, not connections
      - Users don't directly interact
      - Competitors easily replicate at scale

  - id: optimization-trap
    summary: Optimizing a fundamentally broken funnel
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      A/B test everything. Optimize every step. Conversion rate goes
      from 2% to 2.3%. But optimizing a fundamentally broken funnel.
      10x improvement on the wrong thing is still the wrong thing.
    why: |
      Optimization feels rigorous and data-driven. Small wins accumulate.
      But you might be polishing a turd. Most growth comes from category changes,
      not incremental optimization.
    solution: |
      # First, ask if you're solving the right problem:
      10% improvement on acquisition doesn't matter
      if retention is 10%

      # Prioritize:
      1. Fix broken things
      2. Build missing things
      3. THEN optimize working things

      # 10x thinking before optimization:
      What would 10x this metric?
      Usually not A/B testing button colors

      # Optimization is last step:
      Right product → Right audience → Right funnel
      THEN optimize
    symptoms:
      - A/B testing everything except strategy
      - Tiny incremental wins celebrated
      - Fundamental funnel issues ignored
      - No 10x thinking, only % improvement

  - id: more-features-more-growth
    summary: Adding features to solve growth problems
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Growth stalls, so build more features. Users now have more to discover
      but core engagement doesn't improve. Product becomes bloated.
      Features that initially drove growth are buried.
    why: |
      Features feel like progress. But growth usually comes from doubling down
      on what works, not adding more. Complexity hurts more than it helps.
      The best growth lever is often simplification.
    solution: |
      # Audit before adding:
      Which features drive activation and retention?
      Which are used by <10% of users?

      # Consider removing complexity:
      Simplification often > addition
      Focus beats breadth

      # Growth features are different:
      - Referral mechanics
      - Share triggers
      - Onboarding improvements
      These drive growth

      # Not growth features:
      - More settings
      - More options
      - More complexity
      These often hurt growth
    symptoms:
      - Feature count growing, engagement flat
      - New features unused after launch
      - Onboarding complexity increasing
      - '"Feature X will drive growth" repeatedly fails'

  - id: wrong-audience-acquisition
    summary: Acquiring users who aren't your ideal customers
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Acquisition looks great - lots of signups! But wrong users.
      They don't have the problem you solve, can't afford your solution,
      or are tire-kickers. Top of funnel healthy, nothing converts.
    why: |
      Volume metrics feel good. But wrong users waste resources.
      They don't convert, they don't retain, they clog support.
      Quality matters more than quantity.
    solution: |
      # Define ICP with extreme specificity:
      Not: "Businesses that need project management"
      But: "15-50 person agencies struggling with client communication"

      # Measure acquisition quality:
      Track activation rate by acquisition source
      Track retention by acquisition source
      Track LTV by acquisition source

      # Cut low-quality channels:
      Even if CPL looks good
      Bad users are expensive users

      # Align acquisition and activation:
      If sales says "leads are bad"
      Acquisition team must adjust
    symptoms:
      - High acquisition, low activation
      - Activation varies wildly by source
      - Sales team says "leads are bad"
      - Users don't have problem you solve
