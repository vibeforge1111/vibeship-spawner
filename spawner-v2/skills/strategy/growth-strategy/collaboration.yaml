# CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================
cross_domain_insights:
  - domain: Epidemiology
    insight: |
      Epidemiologists know spread:
      - Virality has computable coefficients
      - Network structure determines spread
      - Superspreaders matter disproportionately
      - Herd immunity applies to products
      Viral growth follows epidemic models.
    applies_when: "Designing viral loops"

  - domain: Economics
    insight: |
      Economists know markets:
      - Network effects create monopolies
      - Winner-take-all markets exist
      - Unit economics must work
      - CAC/LTV is fundamental
      Growth must be economically sustainable.
    applies_when: "Modeling unit economics"

  - domain: Behavioral Psychology
    insight: |
      Psychologists know behavior:
      - Habits form through triggers
      - Variable rewards hook attention
      - Social proof drives action
      - Loss aversion beats gains
      Growth leverages behavioral science.
    applies_when: "Designing retention mechanisms"
