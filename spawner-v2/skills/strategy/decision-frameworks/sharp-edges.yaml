# Decision Frameworks Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: framework-worship
    summary: Following frameworks blindly instead of thinking
    severity: medium
    situation: Using frameworks without judgment
    why: |
      Frameworks are tools.
      Context matters.
      Judgment still required.
    solution: |
      ## Frameworks as Tools

      ### When Frameworks Help

      | Situation | Framework Value |
      |-----------|-----------------|
      | Complex decision | Structures thinking |
      | Multiple stakeholders | Creates shared language |
      | Emotional decision | Adds objectivity |
      | Recurring decision | Ensures consistency |

      ### When Frameworks Hurt

      | Situation | Problem |
      |-----------|---------|
      | Simple decision | Overhead |
      | Obvious answer | Delay |
      | Unique context | Doesn't fit |
      | Gaming risk | False precision |

      ### Using Frameworks Wisely

      ```
      1. Choose framework that fits
      2. Adapt to your context
      3. Use as input, not answer
      4. Override when judgment says to
      5. Document the override

      Framework output is recommendation, not verdict.
      ```

      ### Judgment Checkpoints

      ```
      After framework analysis:

      - Does this feel right?
      - What's the framework missing?
      - Would I bet my job on this?
      - What would I tell a friend?

      If gut and framework conflict → investigate why.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Following scores despite doubt
      - "The matrix says..."
      - Can't explain why
    detection_pattern: "matrix says|framework output|scored highest"

  - id: false-precision
    summary: Fake accuracy in uncertain decisions
    severity: medium
    situation: Precise numbers for imprecise inputs
    why: |
      Numbers feel objective.
      Precision feels rigorous.
      Uncertainty is uncomfortable.
    solution: |
      ## Honest Precision

      ### Precision vs Accuracy

      ```
      "This option scores 4.2 vs 4.1"
      → Implies knowable difference
      → Reality: They're effectively tied

      "This option is roughly 2x better"
      → Honest about uncertainty
      → Useful for decision
      ```

      ### Right Level of Precision

      | Input Quality | Output Precision |
      |---------------|------------------|
      | Hard data | Precise numbers |
      | Estimates | Ranges |
      | Guesses | Categories (High/Med/Low) |
      | Unknown | Acknowledge uncertainty |

      ### Avoiding False Precision

      ```
      Instead of:
      - "This scores 3.7"

      Say:
      - "This is in the middle range"
      - "These two are effectively tied"
      - "Option A is clearly ahead"

      Match precision to confidence.
      ```

      ### When Precise, When Not

      | Precise | Imprecise |
      |---------|-----------|
      | Costs | Customer value |
      | Timeline | Market timing |
      | Revenue | Strategic importance |
      | Effort | Risk probability |
    symptoms:
      - Decimal points on subjective scores
      - Debating small differences
      - Confidence beyond evidence
    detection_pattern: "scored 3.7|difference of 0.2|precisely"

  - id: sunk-cost-trap
    summary: Weighing past investment in future decisions
    severity: high
    situation: "We've already invested so much..."
    why: |
      Investment feels wasted.
      Ego attached.
      Commitment bias.
    solution: |
      ## Sunk Cost Discipline

      ### The Rule

      ```
      Past investment is IRRELEVANT to future decisions.

      Only consider:
      - Future costs
      - Future benefits
      - Future alternatives

      What you've spent is spent.
      ```

      ### Reframing Questions

      | Instead of | Ask |
      |------------|-----|
      | "We've invested $1M" | "What's the best use of the next $1?" |
      | "We've spent 6 months" | "What's the best use of the next month?" |
      | "We've already built X" | "Is X the best path forward?" |

      ### The Clean Slate Test

      ```
      Imagine you're starting fresh:

      "If we had to make this decision today,
       knowing what we know,
       ignoring what we've spent,
       what would we do?"

      If answer differs → you're in the sunk cost trap.
      ```

      ### Permission to Pivot

      ```
      Pivoting is not failure:
      - You learned something
      - Conditions changed
      - Better option emerged

      Continuing on wrong path IS failure.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "We've already..."
      - "It would be a waste to..."
      - Reluctance to change direction
    detection_pattern: "already invested|spent so much|waste to stop"

  - id: decision-avoidance
    summary: Deferring decisions indefinitely
    severity: high
    situation: Decision keeps getting postponed
    why: |
      Uncertainty is uncomfortable.
      Being wrong is scary.
      More data feels safer.
    solution: |
      ## Forcing Decisions

      ### Cost of Delay

      ```
      Every deferred decision costs:

      - Opportunity cost
      - Team uncertainty
      - Resource limbo
      - Momentum loss
      - Competitor advantage

      Not deciding IS deciding (to wait).
      ```

      ### Decision Forcing Functions

      | Mechanism | How |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Hard deadline | "We decide by Friday" |
      | Default option | "If no decision, we do X" |
      | Escalation | "If we can't decide, Y decides" |
      | Burning platform | "We must decide because Z" |

      ### Minimum Viable Decision

      ```
      What's the smallest decision that moves us forward?

      Instead of:
      - Decide everything now

      Try:
      - Decide enough to take next step
      - Learn from that step
      - Decide next thing

      Incremental > comprehensive.
      ```

      ### Accountability

      ```
      Assign decision owner:

      "Who is responsible for this decision?"
      "By when will you decide?"
      "What do you need to decide?"

      No owner = no decision.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Let's revisit this"
      - "We need more data"
      - Same decision in multiple meetings
    detection_pattern: "revisit|more research|not ready to decide"
