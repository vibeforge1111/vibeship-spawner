# Growth Loops Validations
# Note: Business/strategy skills have fewer code validations
# Focus on document/planning validations

validations:
  - id: loop-without-metrics
    name: Loop Definition Without Metrics
    severity: high
    type: conceptual
    check: "Loop strategy document must define measurable metrics for each loop stage"
    message: "Growth loop defined without clear metrics at each stage."
    fix_action: "Add specific, measurable KPIs for: trigger rate, action rate, conversion rate, cycle time"

  - id: single-loop-strategy
    name: Single Loop Strategy
    severity: medium
    type: conceptual
    check: "Growth strategy should not depend on single acquisition loop"
    message: "Strategy relies on single growth loop without backup."
    fix_action: "Add secondary loop or acknowledge risk with mitigation plan"

  - id: vanity-metric-focus
    name: Vanity Metric Focus
    severity: high
    type: conceptual
    check: "Loop metrics should measure conversions, not just activities"
    indicators:
      - "invites sent" without "invites accepted"
      - "shares" without "share conversions"
      - "referral links" without "referral signups"
    message: "Loop metrics focus on activity rather than conversion."
    fix_action: "Track end-to-end conversion, not just top-of-loop activity"

  - id: missing-cycle-time
    name: Missing Cycle Time Metric
    severity: medium
    type: conceptual
    check: "Loop analysis must include cycle time measurement"
    message: "Loop analysis missing cycle time - critical for growth projection."
    fix_action: "Add average cycle time measurement and optimization target"

  - id: no-quality-tracking
    name: No Loop Quality Tracking
    severity: medium
    type: conceptual
    check: "Loop metrics should include quality indicators (retention, LTV)"
    message: "Loop tracking volume without quality metrics."
    fix_action: "Add retention comparison: loop-acquired vs organic users"

  - id: unrealistic-k-factor
    name: Unrealistic K-Factor Target
    severity: low
    type: conceptual
    check: "K-factor targets should be grounded in benchmarks"
    message: "K-factor target may be unrealistic for product category."
    fix_action: "Benchmark against similar products; most sustainable K-factors are 0.3-0.8"
