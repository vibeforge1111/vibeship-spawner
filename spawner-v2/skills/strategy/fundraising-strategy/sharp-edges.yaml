    title: SAFE Cap Confusion - Not Understanding What You're Selling
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Founder raises $1M on SAFEs at $10M cap. Thinks they sold 10%. Later
      raises Series A at $20M pre-money. SAFE converts at $10M cap. Actual
      dilution: SAFEs get 10% at Series A, plus Series A investors get 25%.
      Founders own less than expected. Didn't understand SAFE mechanics.
    why: |
      SAFEs are not priced equity. The cap is a ceiling, not a valuation.
      When they convert at a priced round, dilution depends on that round's
      terms. Founders often miscalculate their post-conversion ownership
      because they treat the cap as current valuation.
    solution: |
      1. SAFE mechanics:
         """
         SAFE = Promise of future equity at discount

         CAP: Maximum valuation at conversion
         DISCOUNT: % off the priced round price

         CONVERSION:
         - Converts at lower of: cap or discount
         - Dilution depends on priced round terms
         - Option pool increase adds more dilution

         EXAMPLE:
         $1M SAFE at $10M cap
         Series A at $20M pre-money
         SAFE converts at $10M (cap, not $20M)
         SAFE gets: $1M / $10M = 10%
         Not 5% as founder might expect
         """

      2. Model scenarios:
         - What if Series A is at $15M? $30M?
         - How does option pool affect dilution?
         - What's your ownership at each scenario?

      3. Cap table discipline:
         - Use cap table software (Carta, Pulley)
         - Model every raise before signing
         - Understand fully diluted ownership

      4. When SAFEs stack:
         - Multiple SAFEs at different caps
         - Pro-rata rights complications
         - Valuation cap interactions
    symptoms:
      - "We sold 10%" (SAFE at $10M cap, $1M)
      - No pro forma cap table
      - Surprised at Series A dilution
      - Treating cap as valuation

  - id: signaling-risk
    title: Signaling Risk - When No Becomes Never
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder pitches top VC. Gets "not right now." Raises seed from others.
      A year later, ready for Series A. Goes back to top VC. They pass - not
      because company is bad, but because they already passed. If they invest
      now, it signals they were wrong before.
    why: |
      When a well-known investor passes, it creates signaling risk. Other
      investors wonder why. When that investor doesn't invest in your next
      round despite improvement, it signals even louder. This is especially
      true for top-tier VCs who everyone watches.
    solution: |
      1. Manage signaling:
         """
         HIGH SIGNALING RISK:
         - Famous VCs who pass
         - Previous investors who don't follow on
         - Seed investors not doing pro-rata

         LOW SIGNALING RISK:
         - Funds that don't invest at your stage
         - Partners who left the firm
         - Strategic reasons (conflict, focus)
         """

      2. Pitch strategy:
         - Pitch Tier 2 first (practice, less signaling)
         - Pitch Tier 1 when ready
         - Don't waste top VCs on practice

      3. When investors pass:
         - Ask for specific feedback
         - Understand if it's fixable
         - Know if you can re-engage later
         - Don't burn relationship

      4. Existing investor follow-on:
         - If seed investor not doing pro-rata, have story
         - "They're focused on new investments"
         - "Fund timing didn't align"
         - Or: Why are they not following?
    symptoms:
      - Pitching top VCs before ready
      - Previous investor not following on

    title: Party Round Regret - Too Many Small Checks
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Seed round: 25 angels at $50K each. Everyone's excited. A year later:
      nobody leads Series A. Too many small holders, no one with enough stake
      to lead. Nobody's incentivized to help. Cap table is messy. Angels want
      information. Founder drowning in investor management.
    why: |
      Party rounds (many small investors) seem attractive - many helpers,
      shared risk. But they create problems: no lead investor to champion
      you, no one with enough stake to work hard, cap table complexity, and
      signaling issues if none of them lead your next round.
    solution: |

      2. If already have party round:
         - Identify 2-3 most engaged
         - Focus relationship there
         - Set communication boundaries
         - Consider SPV for small checks next time

      3. SPV strategy:
         - Bundle small checks into one line
         - One point of contact
         - Cleaner cap table
         - Often managed by lead investor

      4. Investor management:
         - Monthly update to all (efficient)
         - Deep engagement with leads only
         - Don't let small checks dominate time
    symptoms:
      - "25 angels in our seed"
      - No investor leading next round
      - Lots of investor communication

    title: Bridge Spiral - The Round That Never Ends
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Company needs more runway before Series A. Raises bridge from existing
      investors. Doesn't hit milestones. Raises another bridge. Then another.
      Now: messy cap table, lots of debt/SAFEs, demoralized team, and still
      no Series A. The bridge became the destination.
    why: |
      Bridges are meant to be temporary - to get you to a specific milestone.
      When bridges become recurring, it signals the milestones aren't being
      hit. Each bridge adds complexity and dilution. Eventually, the cap table
      is too messy for new investors.

         - What if we miss again?

      3. Alternatives to bridge:
         - Cut burn and extend runway
         - Generate revenue faster
         - Pivot to fundable milestone
         - Wind down gracefully

      4. If in bridge spiral:
         - Honest assessment: Is this working?
         - Can you hit Series A metrics?
         - Is there a real path forward?
         - Sometimes shutting down is right answer
    symptoms:

    severity: high
    situation: |
      Big tech company wants to invest. Great terms, strategic value, big
      check. Founder takes it. Two years later: acquirer interested, but
      strategic has right of first refusal. Strategic blocks the deal or
      uses leverage. Exit complicated by strategic relationship.
    why: |
      Strategic investors (corporates) have different incentives than financial
      investors. They may want to control you, acquire you, or block competitors
      from acquiring you. Their "strategic value" often comes with strings that
      hurt your options later.

      3. Protective measures:
         - Limit board rights
         - No ROFR or limit scope
         - Sunset provisions on preferences
         - Information walls

      4. Alternatives:

    severity: high
    situation: |
      Last round was at $100M valuation. Company didn't grow as planned.
      Now raising at $50M valuation. Founders in denial - trying to bridge,
      structure, do anything to avoid "down round." Months pass. Money runs
      out. Eventually take worse terms than early down round would have been.
    why: |
      Down rounds feel like failure, but they're often necessary. Avoiding
      reality by stacking SAFEs, doing bridges, or waiting for "market to
      recover" usually makes things worse. A clean down round is better than
      a messy cap table and no runway.

      3. Negotiating down round:
         - Anti-dilution protection triggers
         - May need pay-to-play
         - Clean up cap table
         - Refresh option pool

      4. Avoiding down round (legitimately):
         - Cut burn, extend runway
         - Generate more revenue

    situation: |
      VC pitches "founder-friendly" terms. No board seat! Pro-rata waived!
      Light governance! Founder takes deal. Things go well... until they
      don't. When company struggles, "founder-friendly" VC has no stake in
      helping. Or: "friendly" terms had hidden gotchas that hurt at exit.
    why: |
      "Founder-friendly" is marketing, not legal terms. What matters is
      actual terms and actual behavior. Some "founder-friendly" funds provide
      less support because they're hands-off. Others have terms that seem
