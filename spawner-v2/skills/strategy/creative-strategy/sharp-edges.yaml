# Creative Strategy Sharp Edges
# Critical mistakes that waste creative investment and fail to connect with audiences

sharp_edges:
  - id: committee-creative
    summary: Too many stakeholders diluting the creative vision
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Creative review has: CEO, Sales, Legal, Product, Finance all adding feedback.
      "Make the logo bigger." "Add more features." "Soften that claim."
      "What if we also..." from everyone.
    why: |
      Design by committee produces mediocre work. Nobody loves it.
      Nobody hates it. Nobody remembers it. Great creative requires
      singular vision. Committees protect, they don't create.
    solution: |
      # Clear creative leadership:
      1. One person owns the vision
      2. Stakeholders inform, not decide
      3. Debate strategy, not execution

      # Feedback protocol:
      Evaluate against brief
      Ask: "Does it meet the objective?"
      Not: "Do I personally like it?"

      # Kill committees:
      - Small creative team
      - Trusted reviewers only
      - Final decider identified

      # Review question:
      "Does this deliver the strategy?"
      Not: "What does everyone think?"
    symptoms:
      - Multiple rounds of watered-down revisions
      - Creative gets safer with each review
      - No one person owns the vision
      - Feedback is about personal preference

  - id: feature-film-syndrome
    summary: Treating every piece of creative like an epic production
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We need a brand video!"
      6-week discovery, agency pitch, 4 rounds of scripting, location scouting,
      2-day shoot, 6-week edit. Budget: $150,000. Timeline: 4 months.
      Result: Beautiful video nobody watches.
    why: |
      Most creative needs speed over perfection. Good enough over great.
      More versions, not better versions. Over-production is slow, expensive,
      and often outperformed by simpler content.
    solution: |
      # Production tiers:
      TIER 1: Quick (1-2 weeks)
      - iPhone/simple shoot
      - Stock + motion graphics
      - Budget: $0-5K

      TIER 2: Standard (4-6 weeks)
      - Professional shoot (1 day)
      - Simple concept
      - Budget: $5-20K

      TIER 3: Premium (8-12 weeks)
      - Full production
      - Multiple locations
      - Budget: $20-100K

      TIER 4: Epic (months)
      - Only for major campaigns
      - Brand-defining moments
      - Budget: $100K+

      # Match production to need:
      Social content: Tier 1
      Product demo: Tier 2
      Brand campaign: Tier 3
      Once-a-year moment: Tier 4
    symptoms:
      - Long production cycles for small uses
      - Budget doesn't match distribution
      - Simple content takes months
      - High cost, low engagement

  - id: trend-hijacking
    summary: Jumping on trends that don't fit the brand
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "TikTok dances are trending!" Insurance company makes TikTok dance.
      "Memes are hot!" Law firm posts memes.
      "Everyone's doing AI art!" Luxury brand uses AI art.
    why: |
      Not all trends fit all brands. Trend participation must feel authentic.
      Forced relevance = cringe. Audience sees through inauthenticity.
      Brand damage from being try-hard.
    solution: |
      # Before participating, ask:
      1. Does this fit our brand voice?
      2. Would our audience expect this from us?
      3. Can we add unique value?
      4. Will this age well?
      5. Is it on-brand or just on-trend?

      # Trend participation spectrum:
      IGNORE (most trends)
      REFERENCE (acknowledge, don't imitate)
      ADAPT (make it your own)
      LEAD (create the trend)

      # Brand-appropriate responses:
      Trend: Dancing brand mascots
      Luxury brand: Don't do it
      Snack brand: Do it perfectly
      B2B company: Reference it cleverly
    symptoms:
      - Forced trend participation
      - Audience cringing in comments
      - Creative feels inauthentic
      - Disconnected from brand voice

  - id: inside-joke-creative
    summary: Creative that only makes sense internally
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "This reference to our founding story is so clever!"
      "I love how we worked in the product codename!"
      "The inside joke about our office is perfect!"
      Audience: "I don't get it. What does this have to do with anything?"
    why: |
      Your audience doesn't know your company history, office culture,
      product roadmap, internal acronyms, or CEO's personality. First
      impression = only impression. No time for backstory.
    solution: |
      # Test with outsiders:
      Show to people who don't work there
      Watch for confusion
      If they don't get it, neither will anyone

      # Rules:
      1. Explain in one sentence (if you can't, too complex)
      2. Assume zero context
      3. Value clarity over cleverness
      4. Clear wins over smart

      # Creative test:
      Show to someone with no context.
      "What do you think this is about?"
      Wrong answer = back to drawing board.
    symptoms:
      - Team laughing at references audience won't get
      - Creative requires explanation
      - Internal references throughout
      - Zero-context test fails

  - id: forgettable-middle
    summary: Creative that's fine but not memorable
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Creative that's not bad enough to reject, not good enough to remember.
      Safe. "Fine." "Nice." Forgettable.
    why: |
      Attention is competitive. Average = invisible. "Fine" = waste of money.
      In a crowded market, forgettable means worthless. You paid for nothing.
    solution: |
      # Memorability test:
      Would someone:
      - Talk about this to a friend?
      - Remember it next week?
      - Screenshot and share?
      - Feel something?

      If no to all = back to work.

      # Push past "fine":
      1. Embrace tension (safe = forgettable)
      2. Find the unexpected (what's the twist?)
      3. Emotional specificity (not "inspiring" → which emotion?)
      4. Kill the middle (go big or keep simple)

      # Creative spectrum:
      Safe -------- Fine -------- Memorable
      (invisible)  (forgettable)  (works)
    symptoms:
      - Reviews say "looks good" without enthusiasm
      - No strong reactions either way
      - Interchangeable with competitors
      - Nobody shares or remembers

  - id: execution-first-approach
    summary: Starting with tactics before strategy
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Let's make a video!" "We need social content!"
      "Can we do an experiential activation?"
      Before asking: What's the objective? Who's the audience?
      What's the insight? What's the message?
    why: |
      Great creative solves a problem. Without problem, no solution.
      Tactics without strategy = waste. Beautiful creative that achieves
      nothing. You made something, but for what?
    solution: |
      # Start with brief:
      1. Objective: What do we want to achieve?
      2. Audience: Who specifically?
      3. Insight: What do we know about them?
      4. Message: What one thing to communicate?
      5. THEN: What format/channel?

      # Creative brief components:
      Background: Context and situation
      Objective: Measurable goal
      Target: Specific audience
      Insight: Audience truth
      Message: One key takeaway
      Mandatories: Non-negotiables
      Deliverables: What we're making
      Success: How we'll measure

      # Process:
      STRATEGY → INSIGHT → IDEA → EXECUTION
      Never skip to execution.
    symptoms:
      - Discussions start with format/channel
      - No brief before concepting
      - Can't articulate the objective
      - Beautiful creative, no results

  - id: platform-ignorance
    summary: Creating content without understanding platform context
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Creating one piece of creative, publishing everywhere unchanged.
      60-second brand video used identically on TV, YouTube, Instagram,
      TikTok, LinkedIn. Works nowhere.
    why: |
      Each platform has different audience mindset, format requirements,
      content expectations, and success metrics. What works on one fails on another.
      Platform-blind creative is waste.
    solution: |
      # Platform-specific creative:

      TIKTOK:
      - Vertical only
      - Hook in first 0.5 seconds
      - Native feel (not produced)
      - 15-60 seconds
      - Sound on, captions essential

      INSTAGRAM REELS:
      - Vertical
      - Hook in 1 second
      - Aesthetic matters
      - 15-90 seconds

      LINKEDIN:
      - Can be horizontal
      - Professional context
      - Insight or education
      - Can be longer

      YOUTUBE:
      - Horizontal
      - Hook in 5 seconds
      - Can be long-form
      - SEO matters

      # Principle:
      Create FOR the platform, not just ON it.
      Adapt the idea, not just the format.
    symptoms:
      - Same asset everywhere
      - Wrong aspect ratios
      - Poor platform performance
      - Doesn't match platform expectations

  - id: vanity-shoot
    summary: Expensive production that prioritizes aesthetics over effectiveness
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "This needs to be beautiful." "Let's get a famous photographer."
      "This should feel cinematic."
      Budget: $200K. Result: Award-worthy visuals. Conversion: Zero.
    why: |
      Beautiful ≠ effective. Awards ≠ results. Expensive ≠ better.
      Production value that doesn't serve the objective is vanity.
      Sometimes ugly performs better.
    solution: |
      # Start with objective:
      What needs to happen after viewing?
      Optimize for that, not awards

      # Test ugly first:
      Does the message work in simple format?
      Then add production value

      # Production value hierarchy:
      1. Message works
      2. Audience responds
      3. Brand-appropriate quality
      4. THEN: Make it beautiful

      # Question:
      "Will more production value increase effectiveness?"
      Often the answer is no.
    symptoms:
      - High budget, low results
      - Awards but no conversions
      - Lo-fi content outperforms
      - Production value for its own sake

  - id: overcrowded-message
    summary: Trying to communicate too many things at once
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Brief says: communicate new feature, reinforce brand values,
      mention the award, include testimonial, show product demo,
      drive to website, promote sale, establish thought leadership.
      In 30 seconds.
    why: |
      One message = remembered. Two messages = diluted.
      Three+ messages = nothing lands. You can't communicate everything.
      Trying to say everything means saying nothing.
    solution: |
      # Single message ruthlessness:
      What ONE thing must land?
      Everything else is bonus

      # Message hierarchy:
      If they remember one thing...
      If they remember two things...
      Everything else: cut

      # Campaign thinking:
      Different messages = different pieces
      Not everything in everything

      # Brief discipline:
      Reject briefs with multiple objectives
      Push back until focused

      # Message test:
      "After seeing this, they will think/feel/do:"
      Fill in ONE thing.
      If you have "and," cut something.
    symptoms:
      - Brief has 5+ objectives
      - Creative is cluttered
      - Message unclear after viewing
      - Trying to satisfy everyone

    summary: Using unrelated attention-grabbers to get noticed
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      "Let's use puppies in the ad!" "Can we get a celebrity?"
      "What if it's set during the Super Bowl?" "Add a trending song!"
      Product: Enterprise software. Connection to puppies: None.
      Result: "Cute ad. What was it for again?"
    why: |
      Borrowed interest grabs attention but doesn't transfer to brand.
      Unconnected entertainment ≠ remembered brand.
      You paid for attention that didn't convert.
    solution: |
      # Relevant attention:
      Attention-grabber connects to product
      Or: Product IS the attention

      # Brand linkage:
      Would this work for a competitor?
      If yes, it's not ownable

      # Earned entertainment:
      The product story IS interesting
      Find the interesting angle

      # If borrowing, link it:
      Celebrity who uses product
      Trend that relates to product
      Entertainment that demonstrates value

      # Attention audit:
      What will they remember: The hook or the brand?
      If just the hook, it's borrowed without linkage.
    symptoms:
      - Entertaining but unconnected
      - "What was that ad for?"
      - Could work for any brand
      - Attention doesn't transfer to recall

  - id: perfection-paralysis
    summary: Never shipping because it's never perfect
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Review round 1: "Needs refinement." Round 2: "Getting there."
      Round 3: "Almost perfect." Round 4: "One more pass."
      Round 5: "So close."
      Never launches. Moment passes. Money wasted.
    why: |
      Perfect is the enemy of good. Timing matters. Iteration beats perfection.
      The best creative in the world is worthless if it never launches.
      Market feedback beats internal reviews.
    solution: |
      # Time-box creative:
      Set deadline. Hit deadline.
      Creative is never done, only due.

      # Good enough threshold:
      Define "good enough" upfront
      When reached, ship

      # Learn in market:
      Ship → Learn → Iterate
      Better than theorize forever

      # Review limits:
      Maximum review rounds defined
      Then it ships regardless

      # Creative shipping rule:
      80% quality shipped > 100% quality never
      Your best guess now > perfect later
      The market is the real test
    symptoms:
      - Endless review rounds
      - Creative never ships
      - Missed moments/deadlines
      - Perfection as excuse for fear

    summary: Creating a single asset instead of a campaign system
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We need a campaign!" Creates: One hero video. Done!
      But campaigns need multiple formats, touchpoints, time.
      One video is not a campaign.
    why: |
      Campaigns need multiple executions to land. Single assets don't
      create sustained impact. Frequency matters. You need a system,
      not a single piece.
    solution: |
      # Campaign system thinking:

      CAMPAIGN COMPONENTS:
      Hero: Flagship creative (video)
      Supporting: Extended/alternate versions
      Social: Platform-native cuts
      Static: Key frames as images
      Refresh: Updates over time

      MEDIA ACROSS TIME:
      Launch: High frequency, hero content
      Sustain: Lower frequency, supporting
      Refresh: New executions, same campaign

      # Before creating hero:
      - How many executions needed?
      - What formats for each channel?
      - How will it evolve over time?
      - What's the refresh strategy?
    symptoms:
      - Single asset called "campaign"
      - No sustained presence
      - No format variations
      - No refresh plan
