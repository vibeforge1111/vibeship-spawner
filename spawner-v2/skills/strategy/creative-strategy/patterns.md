# Patterns: Creative Strategy

Proven creative patterns that build memorable, effective campaigns.

---

## Pattern 1: The Tension Framework

**Context:** Creating compelling creative by identifying and leveraging tensions.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Great creative lives in tension.
The space between what is and what could be.
The gap between expectation and reality.

TENSION TYPES:

Cultural Tension:
What society says vs. what people feel
Example: "You should be happy" vs. "I'm struggling"
Nike: Just Do It (action vs. excuses)

Category Tension:
What the category promises vs. what it delivers
Example: "Insurance gives peace of mind" vs. "Insurance is confusing"
Geico: So easy a caveman could do it

Personal Tension:
What people want vs. what stops them
Example: "I want to travel" vs. "I can't afford it"
Airbnb: Belong anywhere (not just afford)

FINDING TENSION:
1. What does the audience say they want?
2. What actually stops them?
3. Where is the gap?
4. What truth is unspoken?

USING TENSION:
Identify the tension → Dramatize it → Resolve with brand

Example:
Tension: People want to be fit but hate exercise
Dramatize: Show the struggle honestly
Resolve: Our product makes it enjoyable

TENSION TEST:
Does your creative acknowledge a truth?
Is there something at stake?
Is there a gap to bridge?
```

## Pattern 2: The Single-Minded Proposition

**Context:** Distilling complex offerings into one memorable idea.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
One idea, clearly expressed.
The simpler the idea, the stronger the execution.

SMP FORMULA:
For [audience], [brand] is the [frame of reference]
that [single benefit] because [reason to believe].

EXAMPLE:
For busy professionals,
Slack is the communication tool
that reduces email overload
because it organizes conversations by topic.

SMP = "Where work happens"
(Simpler, more memorable, still true)

GETTING TO SINGLE-MINDED:

Start with many benefits:
- Saves time
- Reduces email
- Easy to use
- Integrates with tools
- Fun to use
- Great on mobile

Find the core:
What do all of these ladder up to?
→ Work flows better

Express simply:
"Where work happens"

SMP TESTS:
1. Is it one thing? (not "and")
2. Is it true? (provable)
3. Is it different? (not category generic)
4. Is it simple? (one sentence)
5. Is it inspiring? (creatives can run with it)

BAD SMP:
"The best, most innovative solution for
all your productivity needs"
(Multiple ideas, generic, not ownable)

GOOD SMP:
"Just do it" (one idea, clear, ownable)
"Think different" (one idea, clear, ownable)
"The ultimate driving machine" (one benefit)
```

## Pattern 3: The Unexpected Juxtaposition

**Context:** Creating memorable creative through surprising combinations.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Surprise creates memory.
Unexpected combinations force attention.
Juxtaposition reveals new meaning.

TYPES OF JUXTAPOSITION:

Visual unexpected:
Luxury brand + industrial setting
Tech product + natural environment
Serious message + playful execution

Tonal unexpected:
Serious topic + humor
Simple product + epic treatment
Corporate brand + raw authenticity

Contextual unexpected:
Product in unexpected place
Brand doing unexpected thing
Message in unexpected format

EXAMPLES:

Apple: Silhouettes dancing (music player + movement)
Dollar Shave Club: CEO in warehouse (premium quality + casual)
Old Spice: Absurdist scenarios (boring category + weird)

CREATING JUXTAPOSITION:

1. List brand associations
   What people expect from you
   Category norms
   Visual conventions

2. List opposites
   For each expectation, opposite
   What would surprise?

3. Find meaningful combinations
   Which juxtapositions reveal truth?
   Which enhance the message?

4. Execute with commitment
   Juxtaposition works when committed
   Half-measures feel confused

JUXTAPOSITION TEST:
Is it surprising?
Does it reveal something new?
Does it connect to the brand truth?
```
