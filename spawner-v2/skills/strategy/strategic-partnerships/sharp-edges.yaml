      ## Managing Size Asymmetry

      ### When You're Smaller

      | Challenge | Mitigation |
      |-----------|------------|
      | Low priority | Find champion who cares |
      | Slow process | Patient persistence |
      | Changing contacts | Build multiple relationships |
      | Unfavorable terms | Know your walkaway |

      ```
      Strategies:
      - Find the team that needs YOU
      - Make their champion successful
      - Document everything
      - Build internal advocates
      - Be the easy partner
      ```

      ### When You're Larger

      | Challenge | Mitigation |
      |-----------|------------|
      | Dependency risk | Diversify partner base |
      | Quality variance | Clear standards |
      | Support drain | Scalable enablement |
      | Over-promising | Realistic expectations |

      ### Right-Sizing

      ```
      Questions to ask:

      1. Are we a priority for them?
      2. Are they a priority for us?
      3. Can we get executive attention?
      4. Is there mutual dependency?

      If no to most → reconsider partnership.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Unanswered emails
      - Delayed decisions
      - Unfavorable terms
    detection_pattern: "enterprise partner|big company|startup partner"

  - id: partnership-distraction
    summary: Partnerships consuming focus without results
    severity: medium
    situation: Significant investment, unclear returns
    why: |
      Partnerships feel productive.
      Sunk cost bias.
      Hope over evidence.
    solution: |
      ## Avoiding Partnership Distraction

      ### Time Audit

      ```
      Track actual investment:

      | Activity | Hours/Week |
      |----------|------------|
      | Partner calls | X |
      | Content creation | X |
      | Integration work | X |
      | Support | X |
      | Travel | X |
      | Total | X |

      Compare to: direct sales, product, marketing
      ```

      ### Value Test

      | Question | Check |
      |----------|-------|
      | Revenue this quarter? | $X |
      | Deals in pipeline? | N |
      | Strategic milestone? | Y/N |
      | Would we miss them? | Y/N |

      ### Decision Framework

      ```
      If partnership value unclear after 6 months:

      Option A: Double down (if strategic value clear)
      Option B: Reduce investment (if tactical value only)
      Option C: Exit gracefully (if value unlikely)

      Default to Option C unless strong evidence.
      ```

      ### Opportunity Cost

      ```
      For every hour in partnerships:
      - What else could we do?
      - What's the expected value?
      - Is this the best use?

      Partnerships must beat alternatives.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Lots of activity, little revenue
      - Can't articulate value
      - Team burnout on partners

  - id: dependency-risk
    summary: Over-reliance on single partner

      ## Managing Partner Dependency

      ### Concentration Limits

      | Metric | Yellow | Red |
      |--------|--------|-----|

      | Leads from partner | 30% | 50%+ |
      | Distribution via partner | 40% | 60%+ |

      ### Diversification Strategy

      ```
      Reduce dependency:

      1. Cap growth with partner
      2. Invest in alternatives
      3. Build direct channels
      4. Negotiate better terms

      Never let one partner control your destiny.
      ```
