        PROBLEM: Product is viral but not networked

        FIX:
        1. Add multiplayer value:

           - Shared content (value = audience)
           - Social features (value = community)

           - Don't spread thin across market
           - Concentrate in segments
           - Network valuable at n=10, not n=1000

        3. Track network engagement:
           - % users with connections
