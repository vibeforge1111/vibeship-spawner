    title: Fake Network Effects - Virality ≠ Network Effects
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder pitches: "We have network effects. Users share content and
      invite friends." Growth is viral. Deck shows hockey stick. But when
      growth slows, retention craters. Users leave as easily as they came.
      There was virality, not network effects.
    why: |
      Virality is about spreading. Network effects are about stickiness.
      Virality gets users in the door. Network effects keep them there.
      A product can be viral without network effects (viral videos) or
      have network effects without virality (enterprise software).
    solution: |
      1. The network effect test:
         - Does the product get MORE valuable as users increase?
         - Would a user who left lose significant value?
         - Is there lock-in from the network itself?

      2. Virality vs network effects:
         """
         VIRAL ONLY: User shares → Friend joins → Repeat
         - Value to sharer: Same
         - Value to friend: Independent
         - Switching cost: None

         NETWORK EFFECTS: User joins → Value increases → More join
         - Value to all users: Increases with size
         - Switching cost: Lose the network
         """

      3. Build network effects ON viral growth:
         - Viral gets them in
         - Network effects keep them
         - Design for both, separately
    symptoms:
      - High growth but high churn
      - Users join but don't connect
      - Single-player usage patterns
      - "Viral" in pitch but no lock-in

  - id: data-moat-delusion
    title: Data Moat Delusion - Data Alone Isn't a Moat
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Startup has lots of data. Investor asks about moat. Founder says "data
      is our moat." But the data isn't proprietary. It's scraped, or public,
      or easily replicated by competitors with money. Two years later, well-
      funded competitor has same data and better product.
    why: |
      Data is only a moat when it's (1) proprietary - you have it and others
      can't get it, (2) compounding - more usage = more data = better product,
      and (3) defensible - the data advantage is hard to replicate even with
      resources. Most "data moats" fail all three tests.
    solution: |
      1. Data moat requirements:
         """
         PROPRIETARY:
         ✓ Users create unique data in your product
         ✗ Data from public sources
         ✗ Data that can be scraped/bought

         COMPOUNDING:
         ✓ More usage → better product
         ✗ Data sits unused
         ✗ Improvement is linear, not exponential

         DEFENSIBLE:
         ✓ Years of accumulation needed
         ✗ Can be replicated with $10M
         ✗ Cold start works fine
         """

      2. Data moat examples:
         - Google: Decades of search behavior
         - Waze: Real-time traffic from active users
         - Netflix: Viewing patterns for recommendations

      3. NOT data moats:
         - Scraped web data (anyone can do it)
         - Purchased datasets (available to competitors)
         - Public APIs (same access for all)
    symptoms:
      - "Data is our moat" with no proprietary data
      - Data could be bought or scraped
      - Competitors catching up on data quickly

    title: Marketplace Cold Start Underestimate - Chicken-Egg Is Brutal
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Marketplace idea: Connect X with Y. Build the platform. Launch. Buyers
      want sellers. Sellers want buyers. Neither will come first. Growth
      stalls. Team spends 18 months solving cold start. Runway depleting.
      Competitors who started in niche are now scaling.
    why: |
      Marketplaces have the strongest network effects when working, but the
      hardest cold start problem. You need both sides to have value. Getting
      the first side with no other side is incredibly hard. Most marketplace
      attempts fail at this stage.
    solution: |
      1. Cold start strategies:
         """
         SINGLE-PLAYER VALUE:
         - Make one side useful without other side
         - OpenTable: Reservation system for restaurants (no diners needed)
         - Then add the other side

         SUBSIDIZE ONE SIDE:
         - Pay or incentivize the hard side
         - Uber: Guaranteed hourly for drivers
         - Creates supply, demand follows

         CONSTRAIN MARKET:
         - Launch in tiny market where you can "fill" both sides
         - Uber: San Francisco only
         - Airbnb: Conferences where hotels sold out

         HYBRID MODEL:
         - Be one side yourself initially
         - Amazon: First-party before marketplace
         - Own inventory until third-party takes over

         PRE-AGGREGATE SUPPLY:
         - Scrape or list supply without consent
         - Yelp: Listed restaurants before they knew
         - Create demand-side value first
         """

      2. Marketplace readiness test:
         - Do you have a cold start strategy?
         - How will you get first 100 of each side?
         - What's the minimum viable liquidity?
    symptoms:
      - Building platform before solving cold start
      - "If we build it, they will come"
      - Both sides waiting for other

  - id: switching-cost-overestimate
    title: Switching Cost Overestimate - Customers Can Leave Easier Than You Think
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Company believes customers are locked in. High switching costs. Years
      of data. Deep integrations. Then competitor launches with better
      product and easy migration. Customers switch in weeks. The "lock-in"
      wasn't as strong as assumed.
    why: |
      Companies overestimate their switching costs because they don't
      understand customer motivation. Customers put up with switching pain
      when new product is significantly better or current one is causing
      significant pain. Switching costs are speed bumps, not walls.
    solution: |
      1. Switching cost reality check:
         """
         YOUR VIEW: "Years of data, complex integrations, team trained"
         CUSTOMER VIEW: "This isn't working, we'll figure it out"

         Switching costs delay switching.
         They don't prevent it if motivation is high enough.
         """

      2. Switching cost strength varies by:
         - Pain with current solution (higher = more likely to switch)
         - Value of new solution (higher = more likely to switch)
         - Actual switching effort (lower than you think)
         - Competitive migration tools (getting easier)

      3. Don't rely on switching costs alone:
         - Lock-in from value > lock-in from friction
         - If customers stay only because leaving is hard, they're unhappy
         - Unhappy captive customers are time bombs
    symptoms:
      - Relying on lock-in instead of value
      - High switching costs but customers still churning

    title: Brand Moat Takes Decades - You Can't Shortcut Brand
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Startup wants brand moat. Spends heavily on marketing, PR, influencers.
      High awareness achieved. But when price-checking, customers still go
      with cheaper option. Brand awareness exists, but brand moat doesn't.
      Years of spend, no pricing power.
    why: |
      Brand awareness is not brand moat. Brand moat means customers pay
      premium for your brand alone. This requires years of consistent quality,
      trust-building, and emotional connection. It can't be bought with
      marketing spend. It's earned over decades.

         - Years 15+: True brand moat

      3. Brand moat requirements:
         - Consistent quality over time
         - Category leadership
         - Emotional resonance
         - Status signaling

      4. Startups should focus on:
         - Other moats (network, switching) first
         - Brand as long-term investment
         - Product quality as brand foundation
    symptoms:

    title: Scale Without Advantage - Big Isn't Automatically Better
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Company achieves scale. Large customer base. High revenue. But margins
      are still thin. Competitors with less scale have similar economics.
      The scale didn't create advantage. They're just a big commodity
      business.
    why: |
      Scale is only a moat when it creates structural cost advantage or
      unique capabilities. Pure volume without efficiency gains is just...
      bigger. Many businesses have no scale economies - they're linear,
      not exponential.
    solution: |
      1. Scale economy requirements:
         """

         DOESN'T WORK:
         - Service businesses (linear cost per customer)
         - Low fixed cost businesses
         - Businesses with local competition
         """

      2. Test for scale advantage:
         - "Are my margins improving with scale?"
         - "Is my cost per unit decreasing?"
         - "Can competitors match my economics at smaller scale?"

      3. If scale doesn't help:
         - Don't pursue scale for its own sake
         - Focus on other moats
         - Or accept you're in a commodity business

    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder obsessed with defensibility. Every decision filtered through
      "is this a moat?" Patents filed. Proprietary formats created. Lock-in
      designed. But nobody wants the product. The moat protects a castle
      nobody wants to live in.
    why: |
      Moats protect valuable businesses. Before product-market fit, you don't
      have a valuable business to protect. Focusing on moat before value is
      premature optimization. You're building walls around an empty lot.
