# Competitive Intelligence Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: analysis-paralysis
    summary: Over-researching, under-acting
    severity: medium
    situation: Comprehensive competitive knowledge, no action
    why: |
      Research is safer than action.
      Always more to learn.
      Fear of making wrong move.
    solution: |
      ## Action-Oriented Intelligence

      ### Research Sufficiency

      ```
      You have enough research when:
      - Key competitors profiled
      - Main differentiators understood
      - Win/loss patterns identified
      - Action implications clear

      Don't need:
      - Every detail
      - Complete certainty
      - Perfect information
      ```

      ### Time-Boxed Research

      | Research Type | Time Box |
      |---------------|----------|
      | New competitor profile | 4 hours |
      | Quarterly refresh | 2 hours per competitor |
      | Battlecard update | 2 hours |
      | Win/loss analysis | 1 hour per interview |

      ### Action Requirements

      ```
      Every research effort must answer:
      - What do we DO differently?
      - Who needs to know?
      - When will we act?

      Research without action = waste.
      ```

      ### Decision Triggers

      | Signal | Action |
      |--------|--------|
      | Competitor price change | Review positioning |
      | Major feature launch | Battlecard update |
      | Strategic shift | Strategy review |
      | Multiple losses | Urgent response |
    symptoms:
      - Extensive competitive files, no changes
      - "We need more research"
      - Paralysis when competitor moves
    detection_pattern: "more research|understand better|comprehensive analysis"

  - id: stale-intelligence
    summary: Acting on outdated competitive information
    severity: medium
    situation: Competitive knowledge is months old
    why: |
      Research was one-time effort.
      No refresh cadence.
      Market changed.
    solution: |
      ## Intelligence Freshness

      ### Refresh Cadence

      | Element | Refresh | Owner |
      |---------|---------|-------|
      | Pricing | Monthly | Product Marketing |
      | Features | Monthly | Product |
      | Positioning | Quarterly | Marketing |
      | Strategy | Quarterly | Strategy |
      | Battlecards | Quarterly | Sales Enablement |

      ### Freshness Indicators

      ```
      Stale if:
      - Last update > 3 months
      - Major product launch not reflected
      - Pricing not verified recently
      - Win/loss not incorporated
      ```

      ### Automated Monitoring

      | Tool | Monitors |
      |------|----------|
      | Google Alerts | News mentions |
      | Job board tracking | Hiring priorities |
      | G2/Capterra | Reviews and ratings |
      | BuiltWith | Technology changes |
      | LinkedIn | People movements |

      ### Verification Habit

      ```
      Before using competitive info:
      - When was this last verified?
      - Has anything changed recently?
      - Is this still accurate?
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Surprised by competitor moves
      - Sales reporting different reality
      - Outdated battlecards
    detection_pattern: "when was this updated|is this current"

  - id: competitor-following
    summary: Following instead of leading
    severity: high
    situation: Always reacting, never setting agenda
    why: |
      Easier to copy than innovate.
      Fear of being wrong.
      Competitor validation feels safer.
    solution: |
      ## Leading vs Following

      ### Follower Signals

      | Signal | Problem |
      |--------|---------|
      | "They launched X, we need X" | Reactive roadmap |
      | "They're doing Y, we should too" | Copy strategy |
      | "Wait and see what they do" | No conviction |

      ### Leader Mindset

      ```
      Ask:
      - What do customers need that nobody provides?
      - What's our unique insight?
      - What can we do that they can't?

      Act on these, not competitor moves.
      ```

      ### Strategic Choices

      | Approach | When |
      |----------|------|
      | Lead | You have unique insight |
      | Fast follow | They validated something |
      | Ignore | Doesn't fit your strategy |
      | Compete | You can win head-to-head |

      ### Setting the Agenda

      ```
      Leaders:
      - Define new categories
      - Set customer expectations
      - Make competitors react

      How:
      - Thought leadership
      - Innovation investment
      - Customer obsession
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Roadmap driven by competitor features
      - Always announcing "our version of X"
      - No unique innovation
    detection_pattern: "they have|they launched|competitor doing"

  - id: fud-reliance
    summary: Selling against competitors instead of for yourself
    severity: medium
    situation: Sales leads with competitor criticism
    why: |
      Easier than articulating own value.
      Feels like competitive edge.
      Sometimes works short-term.
    solution: |
      ## Value-First Selling

      ### FUD Risks

      | Risk | Consequence |
      |------|-------------|
      | Credibility loss | Looks desperate |
      | Backlash | Customer defends competitor |
      | Accuracy | Claims get checked |
      | Focus | Conversation about them, not you |

      ### Value-First Structure

      ```
      Lead with:
      1. Their problem (understand deeply)
      2. Your solution (how you solve)
      3. Your proof (why believe you)

      Only then:
      4. Differentiation (why you vs others)

      Never lead with competition.
      ```

      ### Competitive Mentions

      | Situation | Approach |
      |-----------|----------|
      | They ask | Honest, balanced comparison |
      | You know they're evaluating | Landmine questions |
      | They mention strength | Acknowledge, pivot to your strength |
      | Direct comparison | Facts only, no FUD |

      ### Winning Without Negativity

      ```
      "I can't speak to their roadmap, but here's ours..."
      "I've heard good things about them for X. We focus on Y..."
      "Some customers choose them for [reason]. Others prefer us for..."
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Sales decks full of competitor criticism
      - Customers feel attacked
      - Win rate not improving
    detection_pattern: "competitor problems|why they're bad|attack"
