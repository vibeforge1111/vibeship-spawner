      ## Preparation Framework

      ### 1. Know Yourself

      ```
      Your Position:
      - What do you WANT? (Ideal outcome)
      - What do you NEED? (Must-haves)
      - What can you GIVE? (Tradeable value)

      Your Constraints:
      - Hard limits (cannot cross)
      - Soft limits (prefer not to)
      - Timeline pressure
      - Authority limits
      ```

      ### 2. Know Your BATNA

      | Component | Definition |
      |-----------|------------|
      | BATNA | Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement |
      | Reservation Point | Worst acceptable deal |
      | Target | What you're aiming for |

      ```
      BATNA Analysis:

      If this negotiation fails, I will:
      1. [Alternative 1] → Value: $X
      2. [Alternative 2] → Value: $Y
      3. [Alternative 3] → Value: $Z

      Best alternative = BATNA
      Never accept worse than BATNA.
      ```

      ### 3. Know Them

      ```
      Their Position:
      - What do they WANT?
      - What do they NEED?
      - What can they GIVE?

      Their Constraints:
      - Hard limits
      - Soft limits
      - Timeline pressure
      - Authority limits
      - Their BATNA (estimate)
      ```

      ### 4. Find the Zone

      ```
      ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement):

      Your Reservation ←——————→ Their Reservation

      If overlap exists → Deal possible
      If no overlap → Walk away or change terms
      ```

      ### 5. Preparation Checklist

      | Item | Complete? |
      |------|-----------|
      | Know your BATNA | |
      | Know your limits | |
      | Researched counterparty | |
      | Estimated their BATNA | |
      | Identified ZOPA | |
      | Prepared opening | |
      | Anticipated objections | |
      | Planned concessions | |

      ## Interest-Based Approach

      ### 1. Positions vs Interests

      | Positions | Interests |
      |-----------|-----------|
      | What they SAY | What they NEED |
      | Stated demand | Underlying motivation |
      | Often fixed | Often flexible |
      | One solution | Multiple solutions |

      ```
      Example:

      Position: "I need 20% discount"
      Interest: "I need to hit my budget"

      Position has one solution.
      Interest has many solutions.
      ```

      ### 2. Uncovering Interests

      ```
      Ask:
      - "Why is that important?"
      - "What would that give you?"
      - "What problem does that solve?"
      - "Help me understand your constraints"

      Listen for:
      - Underlying needs
      - Real motivations
      - Hidden constraints
      - Unspoken concerns
      ```

      ### 3. Expanding the Pie

      | Instead of | Try |
      |------------|-----|
      | Splitting value | Creating value |
      | Trading dollars | Trading different currencies |
      | Either/or | Both/and |
      | One dimension | Multiple dimensions |

      ```
      Value Creation Questions:

      - What costs us little but helps them a lot?
      - What costs them little but helps us a lot?
      - What third option haven't we considered?
      - What if we changed the timeframe?
      - What if we changed the scope?
      ```

      ### 4. Mutual Gains Framework

      | Dimension | You Value | They Value |
      |-----------|-----------|------------|
      | Price | Medium | High |
      | Timeline | High | Low |
      | Scope | Medium | Medium |
      | Terms | Low | High |

      ```
      Trade low-value for high-value:

      "If we can have faster timeline (you: high, them: low),
       we can be flexible on terms (you: low, them: high)"
      ```

      ## Negotiation Tactics

      ### 1. Anchoring

      ```
      First Offer Strategy:

      When to go first:
      - You have good information
      - You want to set expectations
      - Market rates unclear

      When to go second:
      - You lack information
      - They might offer more than you'd ask
      - You want to counter-anchor

      Anchor aggressively but credibly.
      ```

      ### 2. Concession Strategy

      | Principle | Application |
      |-----------|-------------|
      | Diminishing concessions | Each smaller than last |
      | Label value | "This is significant for us" |
      | Get something back | "If we do X, can you do Y?" |
      | Reluctant giving | Don't concede easily |

      ```
      Concession Planning:

      | Round | Concession | Get Back |
      |-------|------------|----------|
      | 1 | Give A | Ask for B |
      | 2 | Give C (smaller) | Ask for D |
      | 3 | Give E (smallest) | Close deal |
      ```

      ### 3. Handling Objections

      ```
      LAER Framework:

      L - Listen fully (don't interrupt)
      A - Acknowledge (show understanding)
      E - Explore (understand deeper)
      R - Respond (address concern)

      Never dismiss or argue with objections.
      ```

      ### 4. Common Tactics (and Counters)

      | Tactic | Counter |
      |--------|---------|
      | Good cop/bad cop | Address the bad cop directly |
      | Take it or leave it | Test if real, walk if needed |
      | Higher authority | Get to decision maker |
      | Nibbling | Hold firm, reopen other items |
      | Deadline pressure | Verify deadline, extend if fake |
      | Emotional appeal | Acknowledge, return to interests |

      ### 5. Silence Power

      ```
      After key statements:
      - Stop talking
      - Let them fill silence
      - Resist urge to fill void
      - Wait for their response

      Silence is powerful. Use it.
      ```

  - name: Closing the Deal
    description: Reaching agreement
    when_to_use: Final stages of negotiation
    implementation: |
      ## Closing Framework

      ### 1. Closing Signals

      ```
      They're ready when:
      - Asking about implementation
      - Talking about "when" not "if"
      - Detailed questions about terms
      - Introducing other stakeholders
      - Softening objections
      ```

      ### 2. Closing Techniques

      | Technique | When to Use |
      |-----------|-------------|
      | Summary close | After addressing all concerns |
      | Alternative close | When they're comparing options |
      | Assumptive close | When they seem decided |
      | Urgency close | When legitimate deadline exists |
      | Concession close | Final give to seal deal |

      ### 3. Avoiding Last-Minute Problems

      ```
      Before closing:

      1. Summarize all agreed terms
      2. Confirm decision authority
      3. Address any lingering concerns
      4. Agree on next steps
      5. Set timeline for documentation
      ```

      ### 4. Post-Agreement

      | Step | Purpose |
      |------|---------|
      | Written confirmation | Lock in terms |
      | Thank them | Build relationship |
      | Fulfill promptly | Build trust |
      | Check in later | Ensure satisfaction |

      ### 5. When to Walk Away

      ```
      Walk away if:
      - Below your BATNA
      - Bad faith negotiating
      - Terms you can't honor
      - Relationship isn't worth it
      - Better alternatives exist

      Walking away IS a successful negotiation
      (of a bad deal avoided).
