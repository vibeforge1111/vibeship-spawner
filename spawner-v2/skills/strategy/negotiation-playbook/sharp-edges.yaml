    summary: Negotiating without alternatives
    severity: high

      ## Strengthening Your BATNA

      ### Before Negotiation

      ```
      Always develop alternatives:

      1. Identify 2-3 real options
      2. Develop each to be viable
      3. Know exact value of each
      4. Be genuinely willing to take them

      Weak BATNA = weak negotiating position.
      ```

      ### Creating Alternatives

      | Strategy | Example |
      |----------|---------|
      | Multiple vendors | Talk to 3+ suppliers |
      | DIY option | Build vs buy |
      | Delay option | What if we wait? |
      | Different structure | Change the deal shape |

      ### When BATNA is Weak

      ```
      If you can't improve BATNA:

      1. Don't reveal weakness
      2. Emphasize mutual benefits
      3. Build relationship value
      4. Extend timeline if possible
      5. Consider smaller ask

      Never negotiate desperate.
      ```

      ### BATNA Improvement Timeline

      | When | Action |
      |------|--------|
      | Week before | Start alternatives |
      | Day before | Evaluate all options |
      | During | Reference alternatives |
      | If stuck | Walk to alternative |
    symptoms:
      - "We really need this deal"
      - No other options considered
      - Accepting first offer
    detection_pattern: "only option|need this|no alternative"

      ## Preserving Relationships

      ### Relationship-First Tactics

      | Instead of | Try |
      |------------|-----|
      | Threats | Consequences framing |
      | Ultimatums | Preferences with alternatives |
      | Attacking | Addressing concerns |
      | Winning | Finding mutual value |

      ### Reading Relationship Damage

      ```
      Warning signs:
      - Tone shift (cold, formal)
      - Reduced engagement
      - Defensive responses
      - Delayed replies
      - Escalation requests

      If seen → pause, repair, reset.
      ```

      ### Repair Tactics

      | Situation | Response |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Tension rising | Take break |
      | Trust damaged | Acknowledge, apologize |
      | Deadlocked | Find easy win together |
      | Personal | Separate people from problem |

      ### Long-Term View

      ```
      This deal matters, but:

      - Future deals matter too
      - Reputation travels
      - Bridges burn slowly
      - Karma is real

      Win the relationship, deals follow.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Hostile interactions
      - "We won, they're upset"
      - No future dealings
    detection_pattern: "they're angry|damaged relationship|won't work with us"

  - id: accepting-first-offer
    summary: Taking initial offer without negotiating
    severity: medium
    situation: Accepting too quickly
    why: |
      Conflict avoidance.
      Didn't prepare range.
      Seemed fair.
    solution: |
      ## Never Accept First Offer

      ### The Rule

      ```
      First offers are almost never best offers.

      Even if offer is good:
      - They expect negotiation
      - There's likely more value
      - You look weak accepting immediately
      - You may regret later
      ```

      ### Response to Good Offers

      | Response | Effect |
      |----------|--------|
      | Accept immediately | Leaves value on table |
      | "That's interesting" | Signals more needed |
      | Counter-offer | Tests for more |
      | "Let me think" | Creates space |

      ### Counter-Offer Strategy

      ```
      Good first offer response:

      1. Acknowledge positively
      2. "I appreciate that"
      3. "To make this work, I'd need..."
      4. Ask for something reasonable
      5. Get slightly better deal

      Even 5% better is worth the ask.
      ```

      ### Exception

      ```
      Accept first offer only if:

      - Clearly above your target
      - Relationship more important than deal
      - Time is critical constraint
      - You've signaled hard limits they hit

      Otherwise: Always counter.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "They offered, we accepted"
      - No negotiation occurred
      - Later regret
    detection_pattern: "accepted first offer|seemed fair|took the deal"

  - id: negotiating-against-self
    summary: Conceding before they ask
    severity: medium
    situation: Offering concessions unprompted
    why: |
      Fear of rejection.
      Wanting to be liked.
      Undervaluing your position.
    solution: |
      ## Stop Self-Negotiating

      ### The Pattern

      ```
      Self-negotiation:

      Before: "I want $100K"
      Thinking: "But they might say no..."
      Say: "I want $80K"

      You just gave away $20K for nothing.
      ```

      ### Rules

      | Don't | Do |
      |-------|-----|
      | Lower before asked | State your position |
      | Anticipate objections | Wait for their response |
      | Preemptively concede | Let them negotiate |
      | Apologize for asks | Own your requests |

      ### Confidence Building

      ```
      Before negotiation:

      1. Know your value
      2. Document your rationale
      3. Practice stating ask
      4. Prepare for silence
      5. Plan responses to pushback

      Say what you want. Let them respond.
      ```

      ### Handling Internal Doubt

      ```
      If you're thinking:
      "But what if they say no?"

      Remember:
      - That's what negotiation is
      - No is a starting point
      - You can always move later
      - You can never move back up

      Never negotiate with yourself.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Well, I could do..."
      - Preemptive discounting
      - Offering before asked
    detection_pattern: "I could probably|to be fair|you might not like"
