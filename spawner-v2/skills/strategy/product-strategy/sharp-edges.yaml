# Product Strategy Sharp Edges
# Brutal truths that kill products - each edge represents millions in failed startups

sharp_edges:
  - id: build-it-they-will-come
    summary: Building without validating the problem exists
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Brilliant idea. Elegant technology. 6 months building in stealth mode.
      Launch to crickets. Nobody cares. Problem wasn't validated.
    why: |
      Founders fall in love with solutions before validating problems.
      Assume their own pain is universal. Build in isolation fearing
      someone will "steal the idea." Confuse technical innovation with market need.
    solution: |
      # Before writing a line of code:
      Talk to 50+ potential customers

      # Use the Mom Test:
      Ask about their life, not your idea
      "Tell me about the last time you..."
      Not: "Would you use an app that..."

      # Look for existing workarounds:
      Spreadsheets, manual processes, duct-tape solutions
      If people aren't trying to solve this with bad solutions,
      they won't pay for your good one

      # Validation artifacts:
      - 50+ customer interview notes
      - Pattern documentation
      - Willingness to pay signals
    symptoms:
      - "We'll validate after we build the MVP"
      - "The product will sell itself"
      - "We're in stealth mode"
      - No customer interviews documented

  - id: feature-factory-trap
    summary: Measuring success by features shipped instead of outcomes achieved
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Roadmap is a list of features. Success = shipping. Customers request
      features and you build them. Product becomes bloated, unfocused,
      indistinguishable from competitors.
    why: |
      Features are easy to measure. Sales brings feature requests. Competitors
      ship features. Nobody asks "what outcome does this drive?"
      Building feels like progress.
    solution: |
      # Shift from output to outcome:
      Every feature must tie to:
      - Measurable user outcome
      - Business metric

      # The 10x test:
      "Will this make the product 10x better at its core job?"
      If no, probably shouldn't build

      # Say no to 90% of feature requests:
      Focused product doing one thing brilliantly
      > Bloated product doing everything poorly

      # PRD requirements:
      - What outcome does this drive?
      - How will we measure success?
      - What will we NOT build to build this?
    symptoms:
      - Roadmap is feature list without outcomes
      - "Competitors have X, we need X"
      - Success measured in features shipped
      - PRDs describe what, not why
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: more-data-procrastination
    summary: Endless research instead of shipping and learning
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Survey after survey. 100 customer interviews. Market analysis.
      Elaborate spreadsheets. Never ship anything because "still validating."
    why: |
      Research feels like progress without risk of failure. Always one more
      question. Analysis paralysis disguises itself as rigor. Fear of being
      wrong masquerades as thoroughness.
    solution: |
      # Set hard deadline for decision-making:
      After 20-30 interviews, you have enough signal

      # Use "Disagree and Commit":
      Make a decision even with imperfect info
      Ship, learn, iterate

      # Build the smallest thing:
      Test your riskiest assumption
      Real learning comes from market contact

      # Research time-box:
      4-6 weeks max for validation phase
      Then ship something
    symptoms:
      - "We need more data before deciding"
      - Validation phase extending beyond 4-6 weeks
      - Multiple pivots based on research alone
      - Perfect information seeking

  - id: were-different-blindness
    summary: Dismissing competitors because you believe you're unique
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Dismiss competitors because "we're different." Believe your approach
      is unique. Meanwhile, customers see you as yet another option in
      a crowded market.
    why: |
      Founders too close to see from customer's perspective. Technical
      differences feel significant internally but invisible externally.
      Optimism bias underweights competitive threats.
    solution: |
      # Do the Screenshot Test:
      Put your landing page next to 5 competitors
      If customer can't immediately see why you're different,
      you're not.

      # 5-second rule:
      Differentiation must be obvious in 5 seconds
      Not explained in 5 minutes

      # Define or be defined:
      Own a category
      Or get lumped into existing one

      # Position on outcomes, not features:
      Features are copyable
      Outcomes and stories are not
    symptoms:
      - "Our competitors don't really compete with us"
      - Differentiation requires explanation
      - Feature comparison shows similarity
      - Positioning by features, not outcomes

  - id: premature-scaling-death-spiral
    summary: Scaling before product-market fit is confirmed
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Early traction - few paying customers, some press, maybe funding.
      Hire aggressively, build out product, scale marketing.
      Then realize: didn't have PMF. Had early adopter curiosity.
    why: |
      Pressure from investors. Early success creates false confidence.
      Hiring feels like progress. Difference between "some people want this"
      and "the market wants this" is subtle but fatal.
    solution: |
      # Define PMF metrics BEFORE scaling:
      - 40%+ would be "very disappointed" without product
      - Organic word-of-mouth growth
      - Low churn (<5% monthly B2B, <10% B2C)
      - Customers expanding usage unprompted

      # Don't scale until these metrics are hit:
      Growth before PMF = pouring water into leaky bucket

      # PMF signals:
      Retention curves flatten
      Users pulling product (not you pushing)
      Referrals happening organically
      Usage increasing over time
    symptoms:
      - Scaling before clear retention metrics
      - High CAC with unclear LTV
      - "Growth will solve our problems"
      - Churn >5% monthly B2B, >10% B2C

  - id: everyone-is-our-customer
    summary: Targeting too broad an audience and serving no one well
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Target market is "anyone who needs X." Afraid to narrow.
      Messaging is generic. Product tries to serve everyone and delights no one.
    why: |
      Narrowing feels like leaving money on the table. Investors want big TAM.
      "Small" markets feel limiting. Optimize for not missing anyone rather than
      deeply serving someone.
    solution: |
      # Start with smallest viable market:
      Market that can sustain your business
      And you can dominate

      # Geoffrey Moore targeting:
      Specific person + Specific situation + Specific problem

      # Be the only solution for someone:
      Rather than an option for everyone
      You can expand later
      You can't un-dilute focus

      # ICP definition:
      Not: "Businesses that need project management"
      But: "15-50 person agencies struggling with client communication,
            using 3+ tools, losing $10K+/month to inefficiency"
    symptoms:
      - Target market described as broad demographic
      - "Our TAM is $X billion"
      - Messaging uses generic value props
      - Features designed for "users" not specific personas
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: solution-first-backwards-build
    summary: Starting with technology or solution instead of problem
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Start with "We'll use AI to..." or "An app that lets you..."
      Retrofit problems to justify solution. Problem you solve isn't
      the problem customers care about.
    why: |
      Solutions are exciting; problems are boring. Technology capabilities
      inspire ideas. "Build something cool" is more fun than "understand deep pain."
    solution: |
      # Force yourself to articulate problem without solution:
      Can you describe the problem without mentioning what you build?
      If not, you don't understand it

      # Use the 5 Whys:
      Get to root cause
      Surface problem often isn't real problem

      # Interview about workflow:
      Don't mention what you're building
      "Tell me about how you currently..."
      "What's frustrating about that?"

      # Problem statement test:
      If you can't describe it in their words,
      you don't understand it
    symptoms:
      - Pitch starts with solution or technology
      - Problem statement uses your terminology
      - Customers don't recognize problem description
      - Features before use cases

  - id: feedback-whiplash
    summary: Changing direction based on every piece of feedback
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Every customer interview sends you in new direction. Negative feedback
      triggers pivots. Oscillate between strategies based on last conversation.
      Product becomes Frankenstein of different visions.
    why: |
      Individual feedback feels compelling in the moment. Want to be responsive.
      Pattern recognition across feedback is hard. Confirmation bias makes us
      overweight feedback matching our fears.
    solution: |
      # Collect feedback in batches:
      Don't act on single conversations
      Wait for patterns across 10+

      # Distinguish feedback types:
      Execution feedback: How we built it
      Strategy feedback: What we're building
      Treat differently

      # Create a feedback parking lot:
      Log it, don't act
      Review patterns weekly/monthly

      # One opinion = anecdote
      # Ten opinions with pattern = data
    symptoms:
      - Strategy changes after single conversations
      - Product direction unclear to team
      - Multiple pivots in short timeframe
      - Acting on outlier opinions

  - id: vanity-metrics-mirage
    summary: Celebrating metrics that don't indicate business health
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Dashboard shows growing users, downloads, pageviews, followers.
      Celebrate these wins. But revenue is flat, retention is poor,
      engagement is shallow.
    why: |
      Vanity metrics go up and to the right - they feel good. Real metrics
      are harder and often embarrassing. We report what looks good,
      not what matters.
    solution: |
      # Define your OMTM (One Metric That Matters):
      The single number indicating product health

      # For most products:
      Weekly active users who complete core action
      OR monthly retention rate
      OR revenue per user

      # Key question:
      "If users aren't coming back unprompted and doing
       the core thing repeatedly, nothing else matters."

      # Metric depth:
      Not just "opens" but "completes"
      Not just "signups" but "activated"
      Not just "users" but "weekly actives"
    symptoms:
      - Celebrating signups without activation
      - No cohort retention analysis
      - Engagement metrics without depth
      - '"Users" counted without defining active'

  - id: v2-will-fix-it
    summary: Deferring core issues to a future version that never comes
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Early users complain about core issues. Acknowledge but say
      "we'll fix it in V2." Keep building new features instead of
      fixing fundamentals. V2 never comes.
    why: |
      New features more exciting than fixing old problems. Backlog grows
      faster than capacity. Core issues feel expensive. Always pressure
      to ship something new.
    solution: |
      # If something is broken in core flow:
      Stop everything until it's fixed

      # Technical and UX debt compound:
      Like financial debt
      Interest accumulates

      # Quality rule:
      A product that does one thing flawlessly
      > A product with ten features that all kind of work

      # "V2 will fix it" is the biggest lie in product:
      V2 doesn't come
      Or V2 has its own issues
      Fix it now
    symptoms:
      - Known issues in core flow unfixed for months
      - '\"We''ll fix it later\" in sprint notes'
      - New features shipping while fundamentals broken
      - User complaints about same issues over time

  - id: copycat-deathmatch
    summary: Building "X but better" and entering features arms race
    severity: high
    situation: |
      See successful product and build "better" version. Copy features,
      add your twist. Enter crowded market hoping to out-execute.
      Find yourself in features arms race with no differentiation.
    why: |
      Validated markets feel safer. "X but better" is easy pitch. Copying
      reduces research burden. Underestimate incumbent advantages:
      brand, distribution, network effects.
    solution: |
      # Compete on dimension incumbents can't or won't:
      Find the underserved segment they ignore
      Change the game entirely

      # Ask:
      "What can I be the only one doing?"
      Not: "What can I do better?"

      # Blue ocean strategy:
      Different is better than better
      New categories > old categories
      Serve who they don't serve

      # If you must compete directly:
      10x better on dimension that matters
      Not 10% better on everything
    symptoms:
      - Product described as "X but better"
      - Feature roadmap mirrors competitor
      - Competing on price or features alone
      - Incumbent could easily copy differentiation

  - id: users-dont-know-what-they-want
    summary: Ignoring feedback by misquoting Jobs/Ford
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Invoke "users don't know what they want" to justify ignoring feedback.
      Believe your vision is superior to user input. Build what you think
      they need, not what they demonstrate they need.
    why: |
      The quote is misunderstood. Easier to trust instinct than synthesize
      feedback. Some founders have been right ignoring feedback (survivorship bias).
    solution: |
      # The actual insight:
      Users don't know what SOLUTION they want
      They DO know what PROBLEMS they have

      # Your job:
      Understand the problem deeply enough
      To invent the right solution

      # Jobs spent thousands of hours:
      Understanding user behavior
      BEFORE inventing
      The iPod came from understanding people's relationship with music

      # Listen for:
      Problems (yes)
      Behaviors (yes)
      Solutions (interpret, don't implement literally)
    symptoms:
      - Dismissing feedback as "users don't get it"
      - No customer behavior observation
      - Building based on internal intuition alone
      - Surprise when users don't adopt features
