# Taste and Craft Sharp Edges
# The quality traps that create mediocre products

sharp_edges:
  - id: complexity-sophistication
    summary: Adding complexity to appear sophisticated
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Feature has 12 settings. Three nested menus. Configurable everything.
      Feels powerful. Actually unusable. Users confused. Simple competitor
      wins.
    why: |
      Complexity is often laziness in disguise. Understanding what is
      essential is hard. Adding everything is easy. Simple solutions
      require deeper understanding.
    solution: |
      Simplicity practice:

      For every feature ask:
      What is the minimum that delivers value?
      What can be removed without losing core benefit?
      What can be defaulted instead of configured?

      Remove until it breaks. Then add back just enough.
    symptoms:
      - Many settings and options
      - User confusion
      - Power users confused by complexity
      - Simpler competitors winning

  - id: quality-later-promise
    summary: Planning to add quality after shipping MVP
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Ship fast. Add polish later. Later never comes. Product stays rough.
      Users form impressions. Competitors have polish. Catch-up is harder
      than doing it right initially.
    why: |
      Quality is a habit, not a phase. If you ship rough, rough becomes
      normal. Polish is always deprioritized for features. Build quality
      in from the start.
    solution: |
      Quality from the start:

      Definition of done includes quality basics:
      - Aligned elements
      - Consistent spacing
      - Intentional copy
      - Smooth interactions

      Slower initially. Faster overall. Quality compounds.
    symptoms:
      - Rough edges in production
      - Always prioritizing features over polish
      - Quality debt accumulating
      - Competitors feel more polished

  - id: detail-dismissal
    summary: Dismissing details as unimportant perfectionism
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Slightly off alignment. Inconsistent colors. Typos. Good enough. Ship
      it. Users notice something feels off. Cannot articulate. Trust erodes.
    why: |
      Details signal care. Users feel quality even when they cannot articulate
      it. Small imperfections compound to feeling of rough product. Details
      are the surface of deeper quality.
    solution: |
      Sweat the details:

      Every pixel matters
      Every word matters
      Every interaction matters

      Not perfectionism that prevents shipping.
      But care that shows in the result.
    symptoms:
      - Misaligned elements
      - Inconsistent styles
      - Typos in product
      - Users say it feels off

  - id: trend-chasing
    summary: Redesigning to follow every new design trend
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Last year glassmorphism. This year neubrutalism. Next year something
      else. Constant redesign. Users disoriented. Each trend dates quickly.
    why: |
      Trends pass. Timeless principles endure. Chasing trends means
      perpetual redesign and dated feeling within a year. Choose timeless
      and update rarely.
    solution: |
      Timeless principles:

      Simple (will never go out of style)
      Clear (always valuable)
      Consistent (builds trust)
      Functional (serves the user)

      Ask: Will this look dated in 5 years? If yes, reconsider.
    symptoms:
      - Following design trends
      - Frequent redesigns
      - Product feels dated
      - Constant UI changes

  - id: taste-innate-belief
    summary: Believing taste is innate and cannot be developed
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      I just do not have good taste. Cannot improve. Will always make
      mediocre things. Self-fulfilling prophecy. No effort to develop.
    why: |
      Taste is learned, not innate. Study great work. Understand why it
      is great. Compare to lesser work. See differences. Taste develops
      through deliberate exposure and analysis.
    solution: |
      Taste development practice:

      Daily: 30 minutes studying great products
      For each: What makes this great? What would make it less great?
      Compare: Put great and mediocre side by side
      Apply: Use insights in your work
      Seek feedback: From people with better taste
    symptoms:
      - Belief taste is fixed
      - No effort to develop taste
      - Not studying great work
      - Accepting mediocrity

  - id: quantity-over-quality
    summary: Prioritizing feature count over feature quality
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Shipped 20 features this quarter. All mediocre. Competitor shipped 5.
      All excellent. Competitor winning. Users prefer depth over breadth.
    why: |
      Users do not use feature counts. They use features. One excellent
      feature beats ten mediocre ones. Depth creates loyalty. Breadth
      creates confusion.
    solution: |
      Quality over quantity:

      Before starting a new feature, ask:
      Could we make existing features better instead?
      Is the new feature excellent or just adequate?
      Would users prefer depth in what we have?

      Ship fewer things, ship them better.
    symptoms:
      - Many features, none excellent
      - Feature factory mentality
      - Always shipping new, never improving old
      - Shallow feature set

  - id: copying-without-understanding
    summary: Copying design patterns without understanding why they work
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Copied successful product UI. Looks similar. Does not work. Context
      was different. Pattern applied without understanding principles.
    why: |
      Patterns work for reasons. Copying without understanding means
      applying solutions to wrong problems. Understanding why enables
      adaptation to your context.
    solution: |
      Learn principles, not just patterns:

      When seeing good design:
      Why does this work?
      What problem does it solve?
      What is the underlying principle?
      How does that principle apply to my context?

      Copy principles, adapt patterns.
    symptoms:
      - Copied designs that do not work
      - Surface-level imitation
      - No understanding of why things work
      - Patterns misapplied

  - id: taste-as-excuse
    summary: Using taste as excuse to avoid shipping
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Not good enough yet. Needs more polish. Perfection as delay tactic.
      Nothing ever ships. Taste becomes excuse for fear.
    why: |
      Taste is about making better, not making perfect. Ship excellent
      not perfect. Done is better than perfect. Taste that prevents
      shipping is fear in disguise.
    solution: |
      Ship excellent, not perfect:

      Set quality bar (what is excellent for this stage?)
      Ship when excellent bar is met
      Do not wait for perfect

      Would I be proud to show this? Yes = ship.
      Could it be better? Always yes, ship anyway.
    symptoms:
      - Never shipping due to quality concerns
      - Perfection as delay
      - Taste as excuse
      - Fear hidden as standards

  - id: no-feedback-loop
    summary: Building in isolation without user feedback on quality
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Team thinks it is great. Users confused. Internal taste disconnected
      from user experience. Nobody knows because nobody asked.
    why: |
      Internal taste can diverge from user needs. Feedback loop keeps
      quality grounded in reality. What feels polished to team may be
      confusing to users.
    solution: |
      User quality feedback:

      Regular user testing on quality perception
      What feels confusing?
      What feels rough?
      What feels delightful?

      Calibrate internal taste with external experience.
    symptoms:
      - Team loves it, users confused
      - No user testing on quality
      - Internal echo chamber
      - Disconnected from user experience

  - id: ignoring-craft-debt
    summary: Accumulating quality issues without addressing them
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Known rough edges everywhere. Never prioritized. Product feels
      increasingly rough. Compound effect of ignored quality issues.
    why: |
      Craft debt compounds like technical debt. Each ignored rough edge
      adds up. Eventually the whole product feels rough. Pay down craft
      debt regularly.
    solution: |
      Craft debt management:

      Track known quality issues
      Dedicate time regularly (10% of sprint) to craft
      Fix rough edges alongside new features
      Do not let craft debt compound
    symptoms:
      - List of known quality issues
      - Never prioritized
      - Product feels rough
      - Quality degrading over time
