# Founder Character Sharp Edges
# The character traps that limit founder effectiveness

sharp_edges:
  - id: learned-helplessness
    summary: Accepting blockers as permanent instead of solvable
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      We cannot do X because of Y. Full stop. No exploration of workarounds.
      No creative problem solving. Just acceptance that the obstacle is
      permanent.
    why: |
      Resourceful founders find ways around obstacles. Helplessness is the
      opposite of resourcefulness. Every blocker is a puzzle. Treating it
      as a wall is failure mode.
    solution: |
      Reframe every blocker:

      Instead of: We cannot do this because...
      Ask: What is one way around this?
      Then: What is another way?
      Then: What would we do if this HAD to be solved?

      Constraints inspire creativity. Walls inspire giving up.
    symptoms:
      - Blocker accepted without exploration
      - No workaround attempts
      - Waiting for obstacle to resolve itself
      - Giving up at first difficulty

  - id: credential-worship
    summary: Believing success requires specific background or pedigree
    severity: high
    situation: |
      We need someone from Google to solve this. I cannot pitch to investors
      because I did not go to Stanford. Credentials as prerequisite for
      action.
    why: |
      Many successful founders are unconventional. Credentials predict past,
      not future. Capability and character matter more than pedigree.
      Credential worship is an excuse for inaction.
    solution: |
      Capability over credentials:

      Instead of: Who has the right background?
      Ask: Who can actually do this?

      Instead of: I need X credentials to Y
      Ask: What do I actually need to learn or demonstrate?

      Prove capability through action, not resume.
    symptoms:
      - Hiring for pedigree not skill
      - Self-limiting due to background
      - Credential requirements for action
      - Intimidation by credentials

  - id: conflict-avoidance
    summary: Avoiding hard conversations to keep peace
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Cofounder not pulling weight. Team member underperforming. Investor
      overstepping. But we do not want to cause conflict. So nothing is
      said. Problems fester.
    why: |
      Hard conversations are part of the job. Avoiding them does not make
      problems go away. It makes them worse. Founders must be direct,
      even when uncomfortable.
    solution: |
      Direct feedback practice:

      1. Name the issue specifically
      2. Share impact
      3. Listen to their perspective
      4. Agree on next steps
      5. Follow up

      Conflict avoidance is not kindness. It is cowardice that hurts everyone.
    symptoms:
      - Known issues not addressed
      - Walking on eggshells
      - Problems festering
      - Venting to others instead of addressing directly

  - id: idea-defensiveness
    summary: Defending ideas as if they are personal identity
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Team member challenges the approach. Founder gets defensive. Argument
      becomes personal. Best ideas never surface because disagreement is
      threatening.
    why: |
      Ideas are not you. Defending ideas like identity prevents learning.
      The best ideas emerge from rigorous debate. If you cannot be wrong,
      you cannot improve.
    solution: |
      Separate ideas from identity:

      When challenged, ask: Is this true?
      Not: Are they attacking me?

      Practice saying: I might be wrong. What do you think?

      Seek the strongest counter-argument. Better to be wrong now than
      fail later.
    symptoms:
      - Defensive when challenged
      - Ideas treated as personal
      - Debate feels threatening
      - Dismissing criticism

  - id: performative-passion
    summary: Faking enthusiasm instead of genuine belief
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Pitch is polished. Energy is high. But something feels off. Founder
      does not actually believe. Just performing for investors. Unsustainable
      over years.
    why: |
      People detect inauthenticity. Manufactured passion does not last years.
      Earnest belief attracts earnest people. Work on something you genuinely
      care about.
    solution: |
      Authenticity check:

      Do I actually care about this problem?
      Would I work on this even if it was not fundable?
      Am I excited to talk about this on my worst day?

      If no, consider whether this is the right thing to build.
    symptoms:
      - Rehearsed enthusiasm
      - Dreading pitch conversations
      - Different in private vs public
      - Exhausted by pretending

  - id: cynical-detachment
    summary: Ironic distance from work instead of earnest engagement
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Everything is a bit of a joke. Do not care too much. Ironic distance
      from the work. Cynicism as self-protection from failure.
    why: |
      Building great things requires caring deeply. Cynicism is defense
      mechanism. It protects from disappointment but prevents greatness.
      Earnestness attracts earnest people.
    solution: |
      Embrace earnestness:

      Care openly. Risk disappointment.
      Genuine enthusiasm is attractive.
      Cynicism repels good people.

      If you cannot be earnest about this, find something you can be
      earnest about.
    symptoms:
      - Ironic tone about work
      - Hedging enthusiasm
      - Cynical about startup culture
      - Afraid to care visibly

  - id: meanness-rationalization
    summary: Justifying difficult behavior as necessary for success
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder is harsh with team. Justification: Great founders are tough.
      Actually, best people avoid working with them. Reputation spreads.
      Options narrow.
    why: |
      Mean people fail in the long run. Reputation compounds. The best
      talent, investors, and partners avoid difficult people. Kindness
      is a competitive advantage.
    solution: |
      Tough but kind:

      High standards: Yes
      Direct feedback: Yes
      Demanding excellence: Yes

      Demeaning: No
      Personal attacks: No
      Making people feel small: No

      Best people want to work with demanding but respectful leaders.
    symptoms:
      - Harsh treatment justified
      - Team turnover
      - Reputation concerns
      - Best candidates declining

  - id: comparison-paralysis
    summary: Comparing yourself to others instead of focusing on your path
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Competitor raised more. Other founder is more successful. Feeling
      inadequate. Comparison spiral instead of building.
    why: |
      Every journey is different. Comparing yourself to others in different
      circumstances is meaningless. Focus on your progress, not others
      appearance of success.
    solution: |
      Focus on your path:

      Only compare to yesterday you
      Are you learning? Growing? Shipping?

      Other people visible success is misleading
      You see their highlights, not their struggles

      Competition is noise. Building is signal.
    symptoms:
      - Constant comparison
      - Feeling inadequate
      - Demotivated by others success
      - Distracted from building
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: expertise-insecurity
    summary: Feeling like an impostor despite real capability
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Founder actually capable. But feels like fraud. Does not speak up
      in meetings. Does not pitch confidently. Self-doubt limits
      effectiveness.
    why: |
      Impostor syndrome is common but limiting. You do not need to know
      everything. You need to learn fast and ship. Confidence comes from
      action, not permission.
    solution: |
      Evidence-based confidence:

      What have you actually accomplished?
      What problems have you actually solved?
      What do you actually know that others do not?

      Build confidence from evidence, not feelings. Act, then believe.
    symptoms:
      - Feeling like fraud
      - Not speaking up
      - Waiting for permission
      - Self-doubt limiting action

  - id: success-attribution-error
    summary: Attributing success to luck, failure to self
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Things go well: We got lucky. Things go poorly: I am not good enough.
      Asymmetric attribution that undermines confidence and learning.
    why: |
      Success requires both skill and luck. Attributing all success to luck
      prevents learning from wins. Attributing all failure to self prevents
      learning from circumstances.
    solution: |
      Balanced attribution:

      For success: What did we do right AND what was lucky?
      For failure: What was in our control AND what was not?

      Learn from both. Do not dismiss your role in success or your
      environment in failure.
    symptoms:
      - Dismissing wins as luck
      - Blaming self for everything
      - Not learning from success
      - Over-attributing to self in failure
