             you disagreed with. How did you handle it?"

           - Don't hire clones
           - Look for values match, not style match

           - Early hires should interview
           - Their judgment calibrates new hires
           - They spot "not one of us" signals

        5. ONBOARDING CULTURE:
           - First week: Pair with culture carrier
           - Explicit "how we work" doc
           - Feedback early and often

        WARNING: "Culture fit" can become excuse for
        homogeneity. Be specific about what matters.
