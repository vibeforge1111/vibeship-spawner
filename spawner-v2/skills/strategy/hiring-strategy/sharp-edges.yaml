    title: Senior Hire Before Problem Definition - Expensive Solution Seeking
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Startup needs marketing. Founder hires VP of Marketing at $250K. VP
      asks "What's the strategy?" Founder says "That's why we hired you."
      VP creates strategy that doesn't fit. Six months, $150K, no results.
      VP leaves. Back to square one.
    why: |
      Senior hires scale solutions, they don't find them. If you don't know
      what the problem is, a senior hire can't know what the solution is.
      They'll apply what worked elsewhere, which often doesn't fit. You need
      to define the problem before hiring someone to solve it.
    solution: |
      1. Before senior hire, define:
         """
         PROBLEM CLARITY:
         - What exactly is not working?
         - What would success look like?
         - What have you tried?
         - What do you know about why?

         SOLUTION DIRECTION:
         - What kind of solution are you looking for?
         - What constraints exist?
         - What resources are available?
         - What's the timeline?

         IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER:
         You're not ready for a senior hire.
         Hire a doer, or figure it out yourself first.
         """

      2. Right sequence:
         - Founder learns basics
         - Hire doer to execute
         - Identify what scales
         - Then hire senior to scale

      3. What senior hires need:
         - Clear mandate
         - Defined success metrics
         - Resources to execute
         - Authority to make decisions
    symptoms:
      - "We need a VP to figure this out"
      - New hire asking "what should I do?"
      - Strategy changes every quarter
      - Friction between hire and founders

  - id: co-founder-dating-failure
    title: Co-Founder Dating Failure - Marriage Without Dating
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Founder meets potential co-founder at a networking event. Great
      conversation. Complementary skills. Both excited. Within 2 weeks,
      equity is split 50/50. Three months later: disagreements on vision,
      different work styles, misaligned expectations. Messy separation.
      Cap table complicated forever.
    why: |
      Co-founder relationships are like marriages but harder to exit. You're
      asking someone to commit years of their life and tie their financial
      future to yours. Rushing this decision because you're excited is one
      of the most common and expensive startup mistakes.
    solution: |
      1. Co-founder dating:
         """
         BEFORE EQUITY:
         - Work on project together (1-3 months minimum)
         - See each other under stress
         - Disagree on something important
         - Understand each other's working style
         - Discuss failure scenarios explicitly

         DISCUSS EXPLICITLY:

      2. Equity structures:
         - Never 50/50 (need tiebreaker)
         - Vesting from day one (4 years, 1 year cliff)
         - Founder vesting protects everyone
         - Discuss buyout scenarios upfront

      3. Reference checks for co-founders:
         - Talk to people they've worked with
         - Ask about conflicts and how handled
         - Understand track record
         - Check values alignment

      4. Red flags:
         - Won't do vesting
         - Wants equal equity despite less risk
         - Different timeline expectations
         - Refuses to discuss hard scenarios
    symptoms:
      - Splitting equity at first meeting
      - "We just clicked"
      - No vesting for co-founders

  - id: culture-fit-cover
    title: Culture Fit As Cover - Homogeneity In Disguise
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Startup only hires from their network. Everyone is similar background,
      similar education, similar thinking. Described as "great culture fit."
      Team blind spots are never challenged. Eventually: product doesn't
      resonate with users who aren't like the team. Or: everyone panics the
      same way under stress.
    why: |
      "Culture fit" is often code for "similar to us." This feels comfortable
      but creates dangerous homogeneity. Teams that look and think the same
      miss things that diverse perspectives would catch. Culture fit should
      mean values alignment, not demographic cloning.
    solution: |
      1. Define culture fit precisely:
         """
         CULTURE FIT IS:
         - Values alignment (work ethic, integrity, etc.)
         - Communication style compatibility
         - Growth mindset presence
         - Mission belief

         CULTURE FIT IS NOT:
         - Same school
         - Same background
         - Same demographic
         - "Would grab beer with"
         - "Reminds me of myself"
         """

      2. Structured evaluation:
         - Define values explicitly
         - Interview questions for each value
         - Evaluate against values, not vibe
         - Multiple perspectives on fit

      3. Active diversity:
         - Recruit beyond your network
         - Blind resume screening
         - Diverse interview panels
         - Track demographics

      4. Questions to ask yourself:
         - "Would I hire someone who disagrees with me?"
         - "When was last hire who wasn't from my network?"
         - "What perspectives are we missing?"
    symptoms:
      - "Culture fit" without defined culture
      - All hires from same backgrounds
      - Team agrees on everything
      - Discomfort with different perspectives

  - id: equity-regret
    title: Equity Regret - Under or Over Granting
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Scenario A: Founders gave 20% to first employee who was "critical."
      At Series A, employee has more equity than new VP hire needs. Creates
      tension and ceiling on team building.

      Scenario B: Founders were stingy with early equity. Key employees
      leave when offers elsewhere are 5x their stake. Founders saved equity
      but lost people.
    why: |
      Equity is hard to price early. Give too much and you've limited future
      hiring. Give too little and you can't retain. The right amount is what
      creates alignment without destroying option pool. It requires honest
      assessment of value and alternatives.
    solution: |
      1. Equity principles:
         """
         EARLIER = MORE:
         - First 5 employees: 0.5-2%
         - Employees 5-15: 0.1-0.5%
         - Employees 15-50: 0.05-0.1%

         RISK = REWARD:

         - Critical/hard to find: Higher end
         - Standard/available: Middle
         - Junior: Lower end
         """

      2. Avoid common mistakes:
         - Don't give equity for short-term retention
         - Don't match big company equity in %
         - Don't forget about dilution
         - Don't skip vesting

      3. The right conversation:
         - Explain total comp philosophy
         - Show the math on outcomes
         - Be transparent about dilution
         - Discuss refresh grants policy

      4. Refresh grants:
         - Every 2 years for key people
         - Before they're fully vested
         - 25-50% of initial grant
         - Keeps long-term alignment
    symptoms:
      - Early hires have more equity than execs
      - Key people leaving for equity elsewhere
      - No equity philosophy documented
      - Ad hoc equity decisions

  - id: reference-check-theater
    title: Reference Check Theater - Going Through Motions
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Hiring manager asks for references. Candidate provides three names.
      Manager calls, asks "Would you work with them again?" Gets "Yes,
      definitely." Checks the box. Hires. Turns out: references were friends,
      manager asked wrong questions, red flags were there but not probed.
    why: |
      Standard reference checks are almost useless. Candidates give friendly
      references who give positive reviews. Managers ask softball questions.
      Real reference checking requires going beyond provided refs and asking
      questions that surface real information.
    solution: |
      1. Beyond provided references:
         """
         BACK-CHANNEL REFERENCES:

         - Listen for hesitation
         - Note what's NOT said
         - Consistent feedback = signal
         - Contradictions = dig deeper

      4. When to skip formal refs:
         - If back-channels are strong
         - If work sample is clear
         - If you have direct experience
         - But: always do some diligence

    title: Hiring Manager Abdication - Outsourcing Judgment
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder is too busy to interview. Delegates entirely to recruiter and
      team. Gets "approved" candidates. Rubber stamps without deep conversation.
      Hires someone who seemed fine to team but doesn't fit founder's vision.
      Friction emerges. Eventually parts ways.
    why: |
      Early hires require founder judgment. Team can evaluate skills but not
      necessarily vision fit, culture contribution, or strategic role. When
      founders abdicate hiring decisions, they get hires that satisfy team
      but may not serve company.
    solution: |
      1. Founder involvement by stage:
         """
         FIRST 10 HIRES:

         - Vision and mission alignment
         - Long-term potential
         - Culture contribution
         - Strategic fit

      3. Time protection:
         - Interview finalists only
         - Keep it to 30-45 minutes
         - Focus on founder-specific questions
         - Trust team for skill assessment

      4. Building hiring judgment in others:
         - Debrief together after hires
         - Review results after 6 months
         - Share what you look for
         - Let them see your process

      Key employee resigns. Founder panics. Makes counteroffer: 30% raise
      plus title bump. Employee accepts. Three months later: same issues
      that caused resignation. Employee leaves anyway. Founder out 30%
      raise and time spent patching.
    why: |
      People don't leave for money - they leave because something isn't
      working. Counteroffers address the symptom (money) not the cause
      (job satisfaction, growth, culture). Most counteroffer acceptances
      leave within 12 months anyway. You're just delaying the inevitable

         - Thank them genuinely
         - Learn from exit interview
