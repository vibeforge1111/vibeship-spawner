# Product-Led Growth Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: activation-metric-gaming
    summary: Optimizing for activation metric, not actual value
    severity: high
    situation: Activation rate improves but retention doesn't
    why: |
      Teams optimize the metric, not the outcome.
      Users complete "activation" without getting value.
      Metric becomes vanity, not signal.
    solution: |
      ## Keeping Activation Meaningful

      ### Signs Your Metric is Gamed

      - Activation up, but Week 4 retention flat
      - Users complete activation in < 1 minute
      - Activation actions are single-click
      - Users don't return after "activating"

      ### How to Fix

      **1. Validate Against Retention**
      ```
      Monthly check:
      - Do activated users still retain better?
      - Has correlation weakened?
      - Time to revisit metric?
      ```

      **2. Use Composite Metrics**
      ```
      Activation Score = (
        Core action completed × 0.3 +
        Returned Day 2 × 0.3 +
        Used 2+ features × 0.2 +
        Time spent > X min × 0.2
      )
      ```

      **3. Segment Activation Quality**
      - Fast activators vs slow activators
      - Compare retention by activation speed
      - Sometimes slow = better understanding

      ### Activation Metric Hygiene

      | Check | Frequency | Action |
      |-------|-----------|--------|
      | Correlation to retention | Monthly | Recalibrate if drifting |
      | Time to activate | Weekly | Flag if too fast |
      | Post-activation behavior | Weekly | Look for true engagement |
    symptoms:
      - "Our activation rate is 80% but retention is 20%"
      - Users "activate" but don't return
      - Activation feels like checkbox completion
    detection_pattern: "activation rate|aha moment|activated users"

  - id: free-tier-too-generous
    summary: Free tier that never converts
    severity: high
    situation: Lots of free users, very few paid
    why: |
      Free tier satisfies all needs.
      No natural upgrade trigger.
      Wrong users attracted (never pay).
    solution: |
      ## Fixing Overly Generous Free

      ### Diagnosis

      **Calculate Free Economics**
      ```
      Cost to serve free users: $X/month
      Free-to-paid conversion: Y%
      LTV of converted users: $Z

      Payoff: Z × Y% > X ?

      Example:
      - Cost: $2/user/month × 10,000 users = $20,000
      - Conversion: 2% = 200 users
      - LTV: $500/user = $100,000
      - ROI: $100K / $20K = 5× ✓

      If ratio < 3×, free is too generous
      ```

      ### Tightening Strategies

      **1. Add Usage Limits**
      - Cap storage, messages, API calls
      - Limit to trigger when value proven
      - Example: Slack's 90-day message history

      **2. Lock Team Features**
      - Free = individual only
      - Team features require paid
      - Example: Linear's team pricing

      **3. Remove Time-Sensitive Features**
      - No real-time in free
      - Delayed updates/notifications
      - Example: Mixpanel's data freshness

      **4. Limit Integrations**
      - Core product free
      - Integrations require upgrade
      - Example: Zapier's app limits

      ### Warning Signs by Stage

      | Stage | Healthy | Concerning |
      |-------|---------|------------|
      | Month 1-3 | High free users | N/A (expected) |
      | Month 4-6 | 1-2% converting | < 0.5% converting |
      | Month 7+ | Stable 2-5% | Conversion declining |
    symptoms:
      - High free user count, low revenue
      - Free users say "this is all I need"
      - Paid features unused by converted users
    detection_pattern: "free tier|freemium|conversion rate"

  - id: plg-sales-conflict
    summary: Sales team working against PLG motion
    severity: high
    situation: Sales intercepts self-serve deals, damages experience
    why: |
      Sales comp based on any closed deal.
      Self-serve would close without sales cost.
      Sales outreach annoys self-serve buyers.
    solution: |
      ## Resolving PLG-Sales Tension

      ### Root Causes

      1. **Comp Misalignment**
         - Sales paid on deals that self-serve would win
         - No incentive to let product sell

      2. **Territory Confusion**
         - Who owns which accounts?
         - When does sales engage?

      3. **Tool Gaps**
         - Can't see product usage
         - Outreach not informed by behavior

      ### Solutions by Cause

      **1. Comp Redesign**
      ```
      Segment by deal value:
      - <$X ARR: Self-serve only (no sales credit)
      - $X-$Y ARR: Sales assist (reduced commission)
      - >$Y ARR: Sales-led (full commission)

      Add bonuses for:
      - PQL conversion (not just deals)
      - Expansion revenue
      - Account health
      ```

      **2. Clear Engagement Rules**
      ```
      Sales engages when:
      - User requests contact
      - PQL score > threshold
      - Enterprise domain detected
      - Usage indicates high value

      Sales does NOT engage when:
      - User happily self-serving
      - Small team/individual
      - Early in journey
      ```

      **3. Arm Sales with Context**
      ```
      Before outreach, sales sees:
      - Features used
      - Usage frequency
      - Team size
      - Specific actions taken

      Enables: "I see you've been using X..."
      Instead of: "Checking in..."
      ```

      ### Metrics to Track

      | Metric | Target |
      |--------|--------|
      | Self-serve % of revenue | Track trend, not specific % |
      | Sales-assisted LTV vs self-serve LTV | Sales should be higher |
      | PQL → Paid conversion by sales | Should beat self-serve |
      | User complaints about sales | Near zero |
    symptoms:
      - Users complain about sales outreach
      - Self-serve conversion drops when sales team grows
      - Sales taking credit for would-be self-serve deals
    detection_pattern: "sales team|outreach|enterprise"

  - id: time-to-value-creep
    summary: Product complexity increasing time to value
    severity: medium
    situation: New features make getting started harder
    why: |
      Features added for power users.
      Onboarding not updated.
      New user experience degrades.
    solution: |
      ## Protecting Time to Value

      ### Measuring TTV

      ```
      Time to Value = Time from signup to aha moment

      Track by cohort weekly:
      - P50 TTV (median)
      - P75 TTV (slower users)
      - P90 TTV (struggling users)

      Alert if any increases >20%
      ```

      ### Common TTV Killers

      | Killer | Example | Fix |
      |--------|---------|-----|
      | Feature bloat | Too many options shown | Progressive disclosure |
      | Setup creep | More required config | Defaults + defer |
      | Integration deps | "Connect X first" | Work without integration |
      | Learning curve | Complex concepts | Templates + guides |

      ### Protection Strategies

      **1. New User Mode**
      - Simplified UI for first X days
      - Gradually reveal features
      - "Advanced" toggle

      **2. Template-First**
      - Start from template
      - Blank slate = advanced
      - Pre-populated examples

      **3. Feature Gates**
      - Power features hidden initially
      - Unlocked after activation
      - Prevents overwhelm

      **4. Continuous Testing**
      ```
      Monthly new user test:
      - Fresh account
      - Complete activation flow
      - Time and count clicks
      - Compare to baseline
      ```

      ### TTV Dashboard

      ```
      Time to Value Trend

      Week    P50     P75     P90
      -28     2.1 hr  5.2 hr  24 hr
      -21     2.3 hr  5.5 hr  26 hr
      -14     2.8 hr  6.1 hr  30 hr  ← Alert
      -7      3.2 hr  7.0 hr  35 hr  ← Investigate
      Now     3.5 hr  7.5 hr  40 hr  ← Fix needed
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Activation rate declining
      - Users abandoning during setup
      - Support tickets about getting started
    detection_pattern: "time to value|TTV|onboarding|getting started"

  - id: pql-scoring-drift
    summary: PQL model degrading over time
    severity: medium
    situation: Sales complains PQLs aren't qualified
    why: |
      Product changes, signals change.
      Customer base evolves.
      Model not recalibrated.
    solution: |
      ## Maintaining PQL Model

      ### Drift Indicators

      - PQL → Paid conversion declining
      - Sales ignoring PQLs
      - False positive rate increasing
      - Top PQLs not closing

      ### Recalibration Process

      **Quarterly Review**
      ```
      1. Pull last quarter's PQLs
      2. Split: Converted vs Not Converted
      3. Analyze signal differences
      4. Identify new signals
      5. Update model weights
      6. Backtest on historical data
      ```

      **Signal Audit**

      | Signal | Original Weight | Current Conversion | New Weight |
      |--------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
      | Pricing page view | 15% | 8% → 12% | 18% |
      | Team invite | 20% | 15% → 10% | 12% |
      | Feature X usage | 10% | 5% → 18% | 20% |

      ### Adding New Signals

      **Product Changes**
      - New features = new signals
      - Removed features = remove signals
      - Changed flows = revalidate

      **Market Changes**
      - New customer segments
      - Competitive dynamics
      - Pricing changes

      ### Model Governance

      | Cadence | Action |
      |---------|--------|
      | Weekly | Monitor conversion rate |
      | Monthly | Review signal performance |
      | Quarterly | Full recalibration |
      | Major release | Immediate review |
    symptoms:
      - Sales complaining about lead quality
      - PQL conversion rate dropping
      - Model hasn't been updated in 6+ months
    detection_pattern: "PQL|product qualified|lead scoring"
