      ## Activating Dead Partners

      ### Diagnosis

      **Partner Health Audit**
      ```
      Active: Revenue in last 90 days
      Engaged: Activity in last 90 days (training, portal, etc.)
      Dormant: No activity in 90+ days
      Dead: No activity in 180+ days

      Healthy program: >50% active
      Problem program: <30% active
      ```

      ### Reactivation Playbook

      **Tier 1: High Potential Dormant**
      1. Executive outreach
      2. Understand barriers
      3. Dedicated success manager
      4. Co-investment offer

      **Tier 2: Medium Potential**
      1. Automated outreach campaign
      2. Offer incentive/SPIF
      3. Invite to partner event
      4. Provide qualified leads

      **Tier 3: Low Potential**
      1. Final notice
      2. Downgrade tier
      3. Consider termination
      4. Free up resources

      ### Prevention

      **Activation Requirements**
      ```
      Partner not "signed" until:
      - Training complete (30 days)
      - First deal registered (60 days)
      - First deal closed (90 days)

      Miss deadlines → revert to prospect
      ```

      **Partner Onboarding SLA**
      | Milestone | Days | Owner |
      |-----------|------|-------|
      | Portal access | 1 | Ops |
      | Training started | 7 | Partner |
      | Training complete | 30 | Partner |
      | First call scheduled | 14 | Channel mgr |
      | First deal registered | 60 | Partner |
    symptoms:
      - High partner count, low revenue
      - <30% of partners produced revenue this year
      - Partners complaining they get no support

    summary: Direct and channel competing for same deals
    severity: high

      Incentives misaligned.

      ## Channel Conflict Resolution

      ### Root Cause Analysis

      | Conflict Type | Cause | Solution |
      |---------------|-------|----------|
      | Price undercutting | No price parity | Enforce price rules |
      | Account overlap | No territory rules | Clear account assignment |
      | Deal stealing | No deal reg | Enforce registration |
      | Services conflict | Unclear scope | Define partner vs direct |

      ### Rules of Engagement

      **Account Assignment**
      ```
      Named accounts: Direct owns
      Territory accounts: First to engage owns
      Partner-sourced: Partner owns
      Inbound leads: Route by criteria
      ```

      **Deal Registration**
      ```
      Valid registration:
      - Submitted before customer contact
      - Customer confirms partner relationship
      - Protection period: 90 days
      - Renewable once

      Conflict resolution:
      - First valid registration wins
      - Customer preference breaks ties
      - Channel chief final arbiter
      ```

      **Price Parity**
      ```
      Partner price ≥ Direct price - Partner margin

      Example:
      Direct price: $10,000
      Partner margin: 20%
      Partner minimum price: $10,000 × 0.8 = $8,000

      No undercutting below partner floor
      ```

      ### Conflict Escalation

      | Level | Resolution Time | Arbiter |
      |-------|-----------------|---------|
      | 1 | 24 hours | Channel manager |
      | 2 | 48 hours | Channel director |
      | 3 | 72 hours | CRO/Channel chief |

      ### Compensation Alignment

      ```
      Direct rep on partner deal:
      - Full quota credit
      - Reduced commission (50%)
      - Encourage partner support

      Partner on direct deal:
      - Referral fee only
      - No margin
      - Clear expectations
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Sales and partners both claiming deals
      - Customers getting multiple quotes
      - Partners threatening to leave
    detection_pattern: "conflict|overlap|deal registration"

  - id: over-reliance-single-partner
    summary: Too much revenue from one partner
    severity: medium
    situation: One partner drives majority of partner revenue
    why: |
      Easier to work with known partner.
      Others not developed.
      Single point of failure.
    solution: |
      ## Partner Concentration Risk

      ### Risk Assessment

      | Concentration | Risk Level | Action |
      |---------------|------------|--------|
      | Top partner <30% | Low | Monitor |
      | Top partner 30-50% | Medium | Diversify |
      | Top partner >50% | High | Urgent diversify |

      ### Diversification Strategies

      **1. Develop Next Tier**
      ```
      Identify 3-5 partners with potential
      Invest disproportionately:
      - Dedicated success manager
      - MDF allocation
      - Lead sharing
      - Co-marketing

      Goal: Get 5 partners to 10%+ each
      ```

      **2. Vertical Specialization**
      ```
      Different partners for different verticals:
      - Healthcare partner
      - Financial services partner
      - Manufacturing partner

      Each can grow without competing
      ```

      **3. Geographic Diversification**
      ```
      Different partners for different regions:
      - North America
      - EMEA
      - APAC

      Natural separation, less concentration
      ```

      ### Relationship Risk Mitigation

      **With dominant partner:**
      - Deeper relationship (harder to leave)
      - Multiple contacts (not single thread)
      - Joint investments
      - Executive alignment
      - Contract terms (minimums, exclusivity)

      ### Contingency Planning

      ```
      If top partner left:
      - How much revenue at risk?
      - Which customers affected?
      - Who would take over?
      - How fast could we recover?

      Test: Could we survive 90 days?
      ```
    symptoms:
      - One partner >40% of channel revenue
      - Anxiety when partner relationship wobbles
      - No clear backup for key partner
    detection_pattern: "top partner|concentration|dependence"

      | +10% | Channel director |
      | +15% | VP/CRO |
    symptoms:

      - Partners always asking for more
      - Deals less profitable than direct
    detection_pattern: "margin|discount|profitability"

  - id: enablement-underinvestment
    summary: Partners fail because they're not enabled
    severity: medium
    situation: Partners want to sell but can't close deals
    why: |
      Assumed partners would self-enable.
      Enablement is cost, not investment.
      No measure of enablement effectiveness.
    solution: |
      ## Partner Enablement Investment

      ### Enablement Budget Benchmark

      ```
      Partner enablement budget:
      10-15% of partner revenue target

      Example:
      Target partner revenue: $10M
      Enablement budget: $1-1.5M

      Includes:
      - Partner success team
      - Training development
      - Portal/tools
      - Events
      - Content creation
      ```

      ```
      Correlate training with performance:

      Certified partners:
      - Win rate: 35%
      - Deal size: $45K avg

      Non-certified partners:
      - Win rate: 18%
      - Deal size: $28K avg

      Certification ROI: Clear
      ```

      ### Enablement Priority Matrix

      | Capability Gap | Impact | Investment |
      |----------------|--------|------------|
      | Can't demo | High | Demo training + environment |
      | Can't position | High | Sales training + battlecards |
      | Can't implement | Medium | Technical certification |
      | Can't support | Medium | Support access + training |

      ### Self-Serve vs High-Touch

      **Self-Serve Enablement**
      - On-demand training

      - For: All partners

      **High-Touch Enablement**
      - Live training sessions
      - Dedicated partner success
      - Custom enablement plans
      - For: Top tier partners
    symptoms:
