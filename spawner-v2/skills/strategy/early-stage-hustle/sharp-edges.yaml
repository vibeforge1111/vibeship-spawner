# Early Stage Hustle Sharp Edges
# The pre-PMF mistakes that waste your most precious resource: time

  - id: building-without-users
    summary: Heads-down building without continuous user contact
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We'll get feedback after we launch." 3 months of building. Launch.
      Nobody wants it. Could have learned this in week 1 with 5 conversations.
    why: |
      Every day without user feedback is a day building blind. Users don't
      know what they want until they see something. But you don't know
      what to build until you talk to them. It's a loop, not a sequence.
    solution: |
      # The weekly user minimum:

      ## Non-negotiable:
      - 10 user conversations per week
      - Actual conversations, not surveys
      - Watch them use the product if possible

      ## Schedule structure:
      Monday: Schedule calls for the week
      Tue-Thu: User conversations
      Friday: Synthesize and ship

      ## What to ask:
      - "What's the hardest part about [problem]?"
      - "Tell me about the last time..."
      - "How do you solve this today?"

      ## Never ask:
      - "Would you use this feature?"
      - "How much would you pay?"
      (Hypotheticals lie)
    symptoms:
      - Zero user calls this week
      - Waiting until launch for feedback
      - Building roadmap from assumptions
      - Users are an afterthought

  - id: premature-automation
    summary: Automating before understanding the problem manually
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We need to build the automated onboarding flow." Haven't onboarded
      10 users manually yet. Automated the wrong thing. Users still confused.
    why: |
      Manual work reveals what actually needs to happen. It shows edge cases,
      user confusion, real needs. Automation locks in assumptions. Do it
      50 times manually, then you'll know what to automate.
    solution: |
      # The manual-first rule:

      ## Do manually until:
      - You've done it 50+ times
      - You can predict every edge case
      - You're drowning in volume
      - Pattern is crystal clear

      ## What to do manually:
      - Onboarding (call every new user)
      - Support (you answer every ticket)
      - Sales (founder-led)
      - Success (personal check-ins)

      ## When to automate:
      - You physically can't keep up
      - The process is validated and stable
      - Automation will match manual quality
    symptoms:
      - Building automation before doing it manually
      - Onboarding is a black box
      - Don't know why users churn
      - Engineering before validation

  - id: launch-perfectionism
    summary: Waiting for perfect before launching
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "Just one more feature." "Need to fix this bug." "UI isn't polished."
      6 months later, still haven't launched. Competitors shipped and learned.
    why: |
      The market doesn't care about your feelings. Embarrassment is cheap,
      learning is expensive. Every day not launched is learning you're not
      getting. Ship now. Fix later.
    solution: |
      # The launch checklist (that's it):

      ## Required:
      - Core value prop works (barely)
      - Users can sign up
      - You can contact users

      ## Not required:
      - Perfect UI
      - All features
      - Scalability
      - Edge cases
      - Polish

      ## The rule:
      If you're not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.

      ## Accountability:
      - Pick a date this week
      - Tell someone (accountability)
      - Ship it (no exceptions)
    symptoms:
      - In development for 3+ months
      - Always one more thing
      - Afraid of negative feedback
      - Waiting to be ready

  - id: vanity-launches
    summary: Optimizing for press/Product Hunt instead of real users
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Product Hunt launch! #3 of the day! TechCrunch coverage! 10,000 signups!
      Next week: 50 active users. 90% bounce. No retention. Back to zero.
    why: |
      Launches give dopamine, not retention. The users who find you through
      press are not your users. They're tourists. Real users come one at a
      time through manual work.
    solution: |
      # Launch reality:

      ## Press is vanity:
      - One-day spike
      - Wrong users
      - No retention signal
      - Creates false confidence

      ## Real traction is:
      - Users who came individually
      - Manual onboarding
      - Word of mouth
      - Retention over weeks

      ## Better launch strategy:
      - 100 users who love you > 10,000 who bounced
      - One channel, go deep
      - Handpick your first users
      - Product Hunt can come later

      ## When press makes sense:
      - Already have PMF
      - Hiring/recruiting
      - Competitive signaling
      - Not for getting first users
    symptoms:
      - Obsessing over launch platforms
      - Measuring signups not retention
      - Spike then flatline
      - Big launch, small retention

  - id: hiring-before-doing
    summary: Hiring for tasks founders haven't done themselves
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We need a marketing person." Haven't done any marketing yourself.
      Hired someone. They don't understand the product. Bad marketing.
      Fired them. Blame the hire.
    why: |
      Founders need to do every job first. You can't manage what you don't
      understand. You can't evaluate what you haven't done. Do it yourself
      until you're drowning, then you'll know who to hire.
    solution: |
      # Founder-first rule:

      ## Before hiring for any role:
      - Do it yourself for months
      - Understand what good looks like
      - Know the edge cases
      - Feel the pain

      ## Hire when:
      - You're the bottleneck
      - You know what to delegate
      - You can evaluate output
      - You can write the job description from experience

      ## What founders should do:
      - First sales calls
      - First customer support
      - First marketing experiments
      - First code (if technical)
    symptoms:
      - Hiring before doing
      - Can't evaluate the role
      - Blaming hires for failure
      - Delegating too early

  - id: spray-pray-growth
    summary: Trying many channels without going deep on any
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "Let's try Facebook ads, content, SEO, partnerships, and PR."
      Spread thin. Nothing works. "Marketing doesn't work for us."
      Actually, you didn't try anything properly.
    why: |
      Every channel requires focused effort to crack. Spreading across many
      means learning none. One channel deeply understood beats five
      channels touched superficially.
    solution: |
      # Single channel focus:

      ## Pick one channel:
      - Where are your users already?
      - What's your unfair advantage?
      - What can you do uniquely well?

      ## Go deep:
      - 80% of effort on that channel
      - Learn everything about it
      - Get to channel-market fit
      - Only then expand

      ## Evaluate properly:
      - Give each experiment enough time
      - Measure leading indicators
      - Iterate before abandoning
      - Don't blame channel, fix execution

      ## Early stage channels:
      - Manual outreach (always works)
      - Community (where they hang out)
      - Content (if you can write)
    symptoms:
      - 5+ channels at once
      - No channel working
      - Constantly switching
      - Blaming marketing

  - id: stealth-building
    summary: Staying hidden because afraid of competition or judgment
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We can't tell anyone, they might copy us." "Let's stay in stealth
      until we're ready." Months in hiding. No feedback. Building wrong.
      When you launch, realize others solved it already.
    why: |
      Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything. No one will steal your
      idea - they're too busy with their own. Stealth prevents feedback
      and learning. Talk about it constantly.
    solution: |
      # Anti-stealth mode:

      ## Talk about it everywhere:
      - Tell everyone you meet
      - Post on social media
      - Write about the problem
      - Get feedback constantly

      ## Why stealth hurts:
      - No feedback loop
      - No early users
      - No word of mouth
      - False confidence

      ## Competition reality:
      - If idea is good, others will try
      - Speed matters more than secrecy
      - Your execution is the moat
      - Ideas are multiplied by execution

      ## Only stealth when:
      - Regulatory (rare)
      - Deep tech with real IP (rare)
      - Never for consumer/SaaS
    symptoms:
      - Afraid to share
      - NDA requests
      - Secret building
      - Paranoid about competition

  - id: feature-over-distribution
    summary: Building more features instead of finding more users
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "If we had this feature, users would come." Built it. They didn't.
      "Maybe one more feature." Endless feature additions. Zero growth.
    why: |
      Features don't create distribution. Most products fail from obscurity,
      not feature gaps. You need users finding you, not more to show them.
    solution: |
      # Distribution first:

      ## The balance:
      - 50% time finding users
      - 50% time building product
      - Not 90% product, 10% users

      ## Distribution methods:
      - Manual outreach (works for everyone)
      - Content (compounds)
      - Community (if you can find one)
      - Paid (if unit economics work)

      ## When to build features:
      - Users asking for something
      - Retention is the problem
      - Feature unlocks new segment

      ## When not to:
      - "If we had X, users would come"
      - Nobody knows you exist
      - Building to avoid selling
    symptoms:
      - Roadmap full, user count low
      - Features as growth strategy
      - Avoiding distribution work
      - Building in comfort zone

  - id: pricing-avoidance
    summary: Not charging money because afraid of rejection
    severity: high
    situation: |
      "We'll monetize later." "Let's get users first." "Free for now."
      Year later, finally try to charge. Users leave. Never validated
      willingness to pay. Business model doesn't work.
    why: |
      Free users are not customers. Payment is the ultimate validation.
      Charging from day one proves value and attracts serious users.
      Revenue solves most problems.
    solution: |
      # Charge from day one:

      ## Why:
      - Validates real value
      - Attracts serious users
      - Creates revenue runway
      - Forces quality

      ## How:
      - Start with any price
      - Even $10/month proves something
      - Increase until they push back
      - Price is information

      ## Objection handling:
      "Too early to charge" = Fear of rejection
      "Need more features" = Fear of rejection
      "Let's get users first" = Fear of rejection

      ## The test:
      Would your users be very disappointed if it went away?
      If yes, they should pay.
    symptoms:
      - All free users
      - Avoiding pricing conversations
      - Planning to monetize later
      - Free tier with no paid

  - id: scaling-too-early
    summary: Building for scale before proving the idea works
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      "We need to be ready for millions of users." Spending months on
      infrastructure. Zero users. Perfect system for nobody.
    why: |
      Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Scale problems are
      good problems. Most startups die from no users, not too many.
      Build for 100 users, then 1000, then worry about scale.
    solution: |
      # Build for now, not later:

      ## Early stage priorities:
      1. Does anyone want this?
      2. Can we deliver value?
      3. Will they pay?
      4. Can we find more users?

      ## Not early priorities:
      - Microservices
      - Perfect architecture
      - Infinite scale
      - Technical perfection

      ## The rule:
      Build for 100 users
      If you get 100, rebuild for 1000
      If you get 1000, then scale

      ## Warning signs:
      - Discussing scale at <100 users
      - Architecture for millions
      - "We need to do it right"
      - Over-engineering everything
    symptoms:
      - Complex architecture, no users
      - Scale discussions at seed stage
      - Engineering perfectionism
      - Afraid of tech debt
