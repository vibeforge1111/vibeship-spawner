# Pivot Patterns Sharp Edges
# The mistakes that waste pivots or prevent necessary ones

sharp_edges:
  - id: pivot-from-frustration
    summary: Pivoting because things are hard, not because of learning
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Week 4. Initial idea is hard. User acquisition slow. Lets pivot.
      Week 8. New idea is also hard. Pivot again. Endless thrashing,
      never going deep enough to learn.
    why: |
      Every good idea feels impossible at first. Hard is normal. Pivoting
      should be based on learning that the problem is not real, not based
      on difficulty of execution.
    solution: |
      Pivot criteria (need multiple):

      1. Talked to 50+ users about this specific problem
      2. Clear pattern that problem does not exist or is not painful
      3. Discovered a clearly better problem during research
      4. Been at it 3+ months with no signal despite real effort

      Pivoting from difficulty is wrong. Pivoting from learning is right.
    symptoms:
      - New direction every few weeks
      - Less than 6 weeks on current idea
      - Frustration driving decisions
      - No user research behind pivot

  - id: ignoring-pivot-signals
    summary: Persisting despite clear evidence it is not working
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      200 user interviews. Nobody cares about problem. Still building.
      Investors concerned. Team confused. But we are committed to the
      vision. Down with the ship.
    why: |
      Persistence is a virtue, but ignoring evidence is not. When data
      clearly shows the problem is not real, continuing is not grit,
      it is denial. Learning requires updating beliefs.
    solution: |
      Define pivot triggers upfront:

      What evidence would make us reconsider?
      - X interviews with no interest
      - Y months with no paying customers
      - Z metric not achieved by date

      When trigger hits, evaluate honestly.
    symptoms:
      - Clear negative signals being ignored
      - Rationalizing away bad data
      - Team afraid to voice concerns
      - Hope as strategy
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: stealth-pivot
    summary: Pivoting without communicating to stakeholders
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Building something different than what investors funded. Hoping
      nobody notices. Eventually someone does. Trust destroyed. Board
      angry. Team confused.
    why: |
      Pivots are normal. Hiding them is not. Investors back teams, not
      just ideas. They expect pivots. They do not expect deception.
      Proactive communication builds trust.
    solution: |
      Proactive pivot communication:

      To investors:
      1. Share what you learned (data, not just feelings)
      2. Explain why new direction is better
      3. What transfers from old direction
      4. New milestones and timeline
      5. Ask for their input

      Do this before they find out another way.
    symptoms:
      - Investors surprised by new direction
      - Secret building of new product
      - Avoiding board conversations
      - Different story to different stakeholders

  - id: everything-pivot
    summary: Changing everything at once during a pivot
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Pivoting to new market, new product, new business model, new team.
      Actually a complete restart. Nothing learned. Same mistakes likely.
    why: |
      Good pivots preserve something valuable: team, technology, insight,
      customers. Changing everything means learning nothing. Find what
      to keep.
    solution: |
      Preserve something:

      What can we keep?
      - Team and culture
      - Technology and codebase
      - Customer relationships
      - Domain expertise
      - Insight about the problem

      Change one thing, not everything. Learn from what is preserved.
    symptoms:
      - Nothing preserved from previous direction
      - Complete restart mentality
      - All new everything
      - Previous work completely discarded

  - id: slow-pivot-execution
    summary: Taking too long to execute once pivot decision is made
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Decided to pivot three months ago. Still debating details. Old
      product still half-supported. New product half-built. Runway
      burning on both.
    why: |
      Pivots require conviction and speed. Analysis paralysis during
      pivots burns runway without learning. Commit fully. Execute fast.
      Learn from the new direction quickly.
    solution: |
      Fast pivot execution:

      Week 1: Decision finalized, communicated
      Week 2: Old product sunset plan, new product MVP defined
      Week 4: First version of new direction live

      Debate before decision. Speed after decision.
    symptoms:
      - Months between decision and execution
      - Old and new both half-maintained
      - Team unsure which direction to focus
      - Endless refinement of pivot plan

  - id: pivot-blame
    summary: Blaming market or idea instead of learning from pivot
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Previous idea failed. Explanation: The market was not ready. Users
      did not get it. Competition was unfair. No examination of what we
      got wrong.
    why: |
      Every failure has lessons. Blaming external factors prevents learning.
      What did we misjudge? What would we do differently? Honest reflection
      enables better next attempt.
    solution: |
      Pivot retrospective:

      What did we believe that was wrong?
      What signals did we miss?
      What would we do differently?
      What did we learn about ourselves as a team?

      Document learnings before starting new direction.
    symptoms:
      - Blame on market or competition
      - No self-reflection
      - Same mistakes in new direction
      - External attribution for failure

  - id: half-pivot
    summary: Pivoting strategy but not fully committing resources
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Officially pivoted to B2B. But still maintaining consumer product
      just in case. Team split. Neither gets full attention. Both fail.
    why: |
      Pivots require full commitment. Hedging splits resources and
      attention. Neither direction gets what it needs. Pick one and
      commit fully.
    solution: |
      Full commitment:

      1. Sunset old direction completely (with timeline)
      2. Move all resources to new direction
      3. Communicate the change clearly
      4. Burn bridges if needed for focus

      If you are not willing to go all in, do not pivot.
    symptoms:
      - Maintaining old product just in case
      - Resources split between directions
      - Hedging language
      - Team unclear on priority

  - id: wrong-people-pivot
    summary: Keeping team misaligned with new direction
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Pivoted from consumer to enterprise. Team hired for consumer.
      Skill mismatch. Culture mismatch. Slow execution. Frustration
      on all sides.
    why: |
      Different directions need different skills. Consumer and enterprise
      are different worlds. Keeping wrong people hoping they adapt usually
      fails. Honest assessment of fit required.
    solution: |
      Team alignment assessment:

      For each team member:
      1. Are their skills aligned with new direction?
      2. Are they excited about new direction?
      3. Can they adapt, and do they want to?

      Have honest conversations early. Better for everyone to acknowledge
      misalignment than pretend it does not exist.
    symptoms:
      - Skill gaps in new direction
      - Team unenthusiastic about pivot
      - Slow execution in new direction
      - Culture clash with new market

  - id: no-new-milestones
    summary: Pivoting without defining new success criteria
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Pivoted to new direction. Working hard. Unclear if it is working.
      No defined milestones. Months pass. Are we succeeding? Nobody knows.
    why: |
      Pivots need clear success criteria. What would prove this direction
      is right? Without milestones, you cannot evaluate progress or decide
      if another pivot is needed.
    solution: |
      New direction milestones:

      30 days: X user conversations completed
      60 days: Y first users acquired
      90 days: Z metric achieved

      Define what success looks like. Evaluate honestly at each checkpoint.
    symptoms:
      - No success metrics for new direction
      - Unclear if pivot is working
      - Months without clear evaluation
      - Cannot tell if another pivot needed

  - id: investor-surprise
    summary: Investors learn about pivot after the fact
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Pivoted without telling investors. Months later they find out.
      Feel deceived. Trust damaged. Future fundraising harder.
    why: |
      Investors expect pivots. They do not expect surprises. Early
      communication builds trust. Shows you are thoughtful and in control.
      Surprises suggest hiding problems.
    solution: |
      Proactive investor update:

      When considering pivot:
      1. Share the data driving the consideration
      2. Explain options you are evaluating
      3. Ask for input if appropriate

      When deciding to pivot:
      1. Communicate within a week of decision
      2. Share learning story
      3. Express confidence in new direction
    symptoms:
      - Investors learn from others
      - Delayed pivot communication
      - Surprised or angry investors
      - Trust issues with board
