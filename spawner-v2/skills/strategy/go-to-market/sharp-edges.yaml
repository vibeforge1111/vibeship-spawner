    title: PLG Without Product Fit - Not Everything Can Self-Serve
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Founder loves PLG. Builds self-serve flow. Launches with free tier.
      Users sign up but don't convert. Funnel metrics are terrible. Team
      blames pricing, onboarding, features. Reality: the product requires
      hand-holding that self-serve can't provide.
    why: |
      PLG only works when products can demonstrate value quickly without human
      help. Complex products, products with long implementation, or products
      where value takes time - these fight against self-serve. Forcing PLG on
      a product that needs sales creates frustration on both sides.
    solution: |
      1. PLG readiness checklist:
         """
         TIME TO VALUE:
         ✓ Value demonstrated in first session
         ✗ Requires hours of setup to see value

         SELF-SERVE ONBOARDING:
         ✓ User can activate without help
         ✗ Requires implementation or migration

         COMPLEXITY:
         ✓ Core use case is simple
         ✗ Too many ways to use it, need guidance

         BUYER:
         ✓ End user can decide/pay
         ✗ Requires procurement approval

         PRICE POINT:
         ✓ Low enough for quick decision
         ✗ High enough to require justification
         """

      2. Hybrid option:
         - Self-serve for simple use cases
         - Sales for complex deployments
         - Clear paths based on need

      3. PLG-assist:
         - Self-serve for trial
         - Human touch for conversion
         - Keeps trial volume, adds conversion help
    symptoms:
      - High signups, low activation
      - Users requesting demos despite self-serve
      - Lots of support tickets during onboarding

    title: Sales Hire Before Playbook - Expensive Learning
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Founder is doing sales. It's working-ish. VC says hire sales. Hire
      senior AE for $200K. AE asks for playbook. There isn't one. AE tries
      own approach. It doesn't work. AE blames product/leads. Founder blames
      AE. Six months, no results, AE leaves.
    why: |
      Sales hires scale a working process. They don't invent the process. If
      founders can't articulate why customers buy, an AE can't either. The first
      sales hire inherits founder's playbook - if there's no playbook, there's
      nothing to inherit.

         - Common objections and responses

         - Full-cycle sales who can handle ambiguity

         - First sales hire is 0→1, not 1→10
    symptoms:

    title: Wrong Channel for Product - Square Peg, Round Hole
    severity: high
    situation: |
      B2B SaaS company runs Facebook ads. Gets traffic. Traffic doesn't
      convert. Tries TikTok because it's hot. Same result. Meanwhile,
      competitor grows through LinkedIn and webinars. The channel never
      matched the product.
    why: |
      Channels are not interchangeable. Each channel has a native audience,
      content format, and buying behavior. B2B products on consumer channels
      reach consumers. Developer tools on LinkedIn reach recruiters. Channel-
      product mismatch wastes budget and time.

    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Product is ready enough. But: "Let's wait for Product Hunt." Then:
      "Let's get press lined up." Then: "Let's fix that one issue first."
      Months pass. Competition launches. When finally live, momentum has
      shifted. The perfect launch window closed.
    why: |
      Launch feels like a one-shot moment. It's not. Most successful products
      had quiet launches and built momentum over time. Waiting for perfect
      conditions means never launching, or launching when it's too late.
      Perfection is the enemy of progress.

    title: Enterprise Without Enterprise Product - Getting GTM Wrong
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Startup sees enterprise deals are bigger. Hires enterprise AE. Pursues
      Fortune 500. Gets in conversations. Then: "Do you have SSO?" "SOC 2?"
      "On-prem option?" "99.99% SLA?" No, no, no, no. Deals die. Enterprise
      requires enterprise infrastructure.
    why: |
      Enterprise isn't just bigger deals - it's different product requirements.
      Security, compliance, administration, SLAs, integration, support. You can't
      just sell SMB product at enterprise prices. The buyer expectations are

    title: Viral Coefficient Fantasy - Hoping for K>1
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Founder builds "viral" features. Share buttons everywhere. Referral
      program designed. Launch. K=0.1. For every 10 users, 1 refers, and
      10% of referred convert. Net: 0.01 new users per user. That's not
      viral, that's barely alive.
    why: |
      True virality (K>1) is extremely rare. Most products are not inherently
      viral. Adding share buttons doesn't make them viral. Viral products have
      virality baked into core value - the product is better when shared. Most
      products are single-player with optional sharing.

         MOST PRODUCTS: K = 0.1-0.3

      2. What actually drives virality:
         - Built into product value (WhatsApp - need contacts)
         - Social proof visible (Twitter - followers)
         - Network effects (Figma - collaboration)
         - Status/identity (Instagram - presence)

      3. If not naturally viral:
         - Don't force it
         - Focus on other channels
         - Referral as supplement, not strategy
         - Word of mouth ≠ virality

      4. Referral program reality:
         - Works as acceleration
         - Not a primary acquisition channel
         - Best customers don't need incentive

  - id: channel-cac-ignorance
    title: Channel CAC Ignorance - Not Knowing True Costs
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Marketing says CAC is $50. But that's just ad spend divided by signups.
      Doesn't include: team time, tool costs, conversion from signup to paid,
      attribution across channels, time to recover. Real CAC is $300. LTV is
      $400. Margin is thin. They didn't know until it was too late.
    why: |
      CAC is easy to miscalculate. Companies often use "simple CAC" (ad spend
      / customers) instead of "true CAC" (all costs / customers). They also
      ignore that not all signups become customers, and that attribution is
      messy. The number that matters is fully-loaded CAC.
    solution: |
      1. CAC calculations:
         """
         SIMPLE CAC (wrong):
         Ad spend / New customers

         FULLY LOADED CAC (right):

          Content + Events + Overhead) / New customers

         BLENDED CAC (mixed):
         All acquisition costs / All new customers
         (Includes organic - makes you look better)

         PAID CAC (specific):
         Paid channel costs / Paid-attributed customers
         (Most expensive, but real for that channel)
         """

      2. The LTV/CAC reality:
         - LTV/CAC > 3 is good for software
         - Payback < 12 months is healthy
         - Factor in churn when calculating LTV
         - Early stage: ratio is a guess

      3. What to track:
         - CAC by channel (fully loaded)
         - Conversion rates (signup → customer)
         - Payback period
         - LTV trend (is it increasing?)

      4. Attribution challenges:
         - Multi-touch attribution is messy
         - Last-click overstates paid
         - First-touch overstates organic
         - Accept some uncertainty
    symptoms:
      - Only tracking ad spend
      - Not including salaries in CAC
