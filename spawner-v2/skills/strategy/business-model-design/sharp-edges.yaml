# Business Model Design Sharp Edges

sharp_edges:
  - id: unit-economics-denial
    summary: Ignoring or rationalizing bad unit economics
    severity: high
    situation: Business losing money on every customer
    why: |
      Hope that scale will fix it.
      VC money masks problems.
      Focus on growth, not profitability.
    solution: |
      ## Facing Unit Economics Reality

      ### Healthy vs Unhealthy Rationalization

      | Unhealthy | Reality Check |
      |-----------|---------------|
      | "We'll make it up on volume" | Losing more at scale |
      | "CAC will drop with brand" | When? How much? |
      | "Expansion will fix LTV" | Prove it at small scale |
      | "Competitors lose money too" | Not a strategy |

      ### Unit Economics Audit

      ```
      Calculate honestly:
      - True CAC (include all costs)
      - True COGS (all delivery costs)
      - True churn (annualized)
      - True LTV (conservative assumptions)

      LTV:CAC < 2? You have a problem.
      ```

      ### Fix Paths

      | Problem | Solutions |
      |---------|-----------|
      | CAC too high | Better targeting, lower cost channels, PLG |
      | COGS too high | Automation, renegotiate, simplify |
      | Churn too high | Product improvement, success investment |
      | ARPU too low | Pricing, upsell, better customers |

      ### When Unit Economics Can Be Fixed Later

      ```
      Defensible only when:
      - Network effects require scale first
      - Winner-take-all dynamics
      - Clear path to profitable cohorts
      - Investors understand and fund path

      Even then: Monitor closely.
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Burn rate increasing faster than revenue
      - "We'll figure out monetization later"
      - Avoiding detailed unit economics analysis
    detection_pattern: "unit economics|LTV|CAC|profitability"

  - id: revenue-model-mismatch
    summary: Choosing revenue model that doesn't fit
    severity: high
    situation: Customers don't want to buy this way
    why: |
      Copied model without context.
      Didn't research how customers buy.
      Optimized for you, not customer.
    solution: |
      ## Revenue Model Fit

      ### Customer Buying Signals

      | Signal | Model Implication |
      |--------|-------------------|
      | "We have annual budgets" | Annual contracts |
      | "We don't know usage yet" | Subscription vs usage |
      | "We want to try first" | Free tier needed |
      | "We buy from procurement" | Enterprise model |

      ### Model-Market Fit Check

      ```
      Research:
      1. How do customers buy similar products?
      2. What are they currently paying?
      3. Who approves the purchase?
      4. What's their payment preference?

      Match model to answers.
      ```

      ### Warning Signs

      | Sign | Likely Issue |
      |------|--------------|
      | Long sales cycles | Model too complex |
      | Price objections | Wrong pricing model |
      | Low conversion | Friction in model |
      | High churn | Value not perceived |

      ### Model Adjustment

      ```
      If model isn't working:
      1. Interview churned/lost customers
      2. Ask why they didn't buy
      3. Test alternative models
      4. Don't assume you know best
      ```
    symptoms:
      - Customers asking for different buying options
      - Lost deals due to pricing model
      - Low conversion despite interest
    detection_pattern: "revenue model|pricing model|how to charge"

  - id: multi-sided-imbalance
    summary: Platform/marketplace with unbalanced sides
    severity: high
    situation: Can't grow both sides together
    why: |
      Chicken-and-egg problem.
      One side subsidizes other poorly.
      Wrong side monetized.
    solution: |
      ## Multi-Sided Platform Balance

      ### The Chicken-Egg Problem

      ```
      Marketplaces need both sides:
      - Sellers won't come without buyers
      - Buyers won't come without sellers

      Solving this:
      1. Seed one side first
      2. Single-player mode value
      3. Subsidize harder side
      ```

      ### Which Side to Subsidize

      | Subsidize | When |
      |-----------|------|
      | Supply (sellers) | Supply is scarce, unique |
      | Demand (buyers) | Demand is scarce, valuable |
      | Neither | Organic network effects |

      ### Monetization Side Selection

      ```
      Charge the side that:
      - Gets more value
      - Has more alternatives
      - Is less price sensitive
      - Isn't the growth constraint

      Example:
      - Airbnb: Hosts pay (supply constrained)
      - Uber: Riders pay (demand side)
      - LinkedIn: Recruiters pay (value received)
      ```

      ### Balance Metrics

      | Metric | Healthy |
      |--------|---------|
      | Supply/Demand ratio | Stable |
      | Time to match | Decreasing |
      | Transaction success | >80% |
      | Both-side retention | Healthy |
    symptoms:
      - One side of marketplace dying
      - Can't attract one side
      - Transactions not happening
    detection_pattern: "marketplace|platform|two-sided"

  - id: free-forever
    summary: No path from free to revenue
    severity: medium
    situation: Users love free, won't pay
    why: |
      Free tier too generous.
      Paid value unclear.
      No upgrade triggers.
    solution: |
      ## Freemium Path Design

      ### Free Tier Principles

      ```
      Free tier should:
      - Deliver core value
      - Create habit
      - NOT satisfy all needs

      Free tier should NOT:
      - Give everything away
      - Have no limits
      - Feel complete
      ```

      ### Upgrade Trigger Design

      | Trigger | Mechanism |
      |---------|-----------|
      | Usage limits | Hit the wall naturally |
      | Team needs | Collaboration requires upgrade |
      | Feature locks | Advanced features gated |
      | Support levels | Better support for paid |

      ### Conversion Funnel

      ```
      Free user →
        Experiences value →
          Hits limit or needs more →
            Sees clear upgrade path →
              Converts

      Each step needs design and measurement.
      ```

      ### Free Tier Audit

      Questions:
      - What % of free users could be satisfied forever?
      - What triggers exist for upgrade?
      - How clear is the value of paid?
      - Are free users becoming paid over time?
    symptoms:
      - High free usage, low conversion
      - Free users never upgrade
      - "Why would I pay?"
    detection_pattern: "freemium|free tier|conversion"

  - id: complexity-creep
    summary: Business model becoming too complex
    severity: medium
    situation: Too many pricing tiers, add-ons, options
    why: |
      Added complexity over time.
      Trying to please everyone.
      No model simplification discipline.
    solution: |
      ## Model Simplification

      ### Complexity Signals

      | Signal | Meaning |
      |--------|---------|
      | Sales needs config sheets | Too complex |
      | Customers ask "which one?" | Unclear tiers |
      | Multiple discount types | Price integrity lost |
      | Revenue spread thin | Too many options |

      ### Simplification Principles

      ```
      Good rule: 3 tiers maximum
      - Starter: Entry point
      - Pro/Growth: Main revenue
      - Enterprise: High-touch

      Add-ons should be rare, high-value.
      ```

      ### Complexity Audit

      ```
      List all:
      - Pricing tiers
      - Add-on options
      - Discount types
      - Contract variations

      If > 20 combinations: Simplify.
      ```

      ### Migration Path

      When simplifying:
      1. Grandfather existing customers
      2. Migrate new customers to simple
      3. Gradually transition existing
      4. Communicate value
    symptoms:
      - Sales cycles lengthening
      - Customers confused
      - Finance struggling to track
    detection_pattern: "pricing complexity|too many options|simplify"
