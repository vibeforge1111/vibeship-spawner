  - id: default-dead-denial
    summary: Not knowing whether you're default alive or default dead
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      12 months runway. Growing 10% MoM. Think everything is fine. Actually
      default dead - growth won't outrun burn before money runs out. By the
      time you realize, it's too late to fix.
    why: |
      Paul Graham's default alive/dead framework: if you maintain current growth
      and burn, will you become profitable before running out of money? Most
      founders don't do this math. Hope is not a strategy.
    solution: |
      # Default alive calculation:
      runway_months = cash / monthly_burn
      months_to_profitable = f(growth_rate, margins)

      If runway_months < months_to_profitable: DEFAULT DEAD
      If runway_months > months_to_profitable: DEFAULT ALIVE

      # Monthly check:
      Every month, recalculate. Things change.

      # If default dead:
      Option 1: Cut burn now (extend runway)
      Option 2: Raise money now (add runway)
      Option 3: Accelerate growth dramatically
      Option 4: Admit it and wind down gracefully

      # The honest conversation:
      "At current trajectory, we run out of money in X months.
      Here's our plan to become default alive."
    symptoms:
      - Don't know runway calculation
      - '"We''ll figure it out"'
      - Assuming next round will happen
      - Not tracking burn weekly

  - id: optimistic-fundraise-timing
    summary: Planning to raise money at the last minute
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      6 months runway. "We should start fundraising soon." Fundraising takes
      3-6 months. By the time you close, you have 2 weeks of cash and terrible
      terms because investors smell desperation.
    why: |
      Fundraising always takes longer than expected. Investors can smell desperation.
      Closing with 3 months runway vs 12 months runway gets you completely different
      terms. The time to raise is when you don't need to.
    solution: |
      # Fundraising timeline rule:
      Start raising when you have 18+ months runway
      Assume it takes 6 months
      Have 12 months buffer after close

      # If already short runway:
      - Bridge from existing investors (faster)
      - Cut burn dramatically (buy time)
      - Revenue sprint (most leverage)

      # Desperation signals investors detect:
      - Reaching out without warm intro
      - Too eager to close
      - Accepting bad terms quickly
      - Monthly updates suddenly starting

      # Position of strength:
      "We don't need money. We're raising to accelerate."
    symptoms:
      - 6 months runway, haven't started raising
      - '"We''ll raise when we hit [metric]"'
      - No investor relationships before fundraising
      - Assuming 30-day fundraise

  - id: stealth-burn-creep
    summary: Burn rate slowly increasing without noticing
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Started at $50K/month burn. Now $150K/month. Can't explain what changed.
      Runway went from 24 months to 8 months. "Where did the money go?"
    why: |
      Burn creep is death by a thousand cuts. Each decision is small - one more
      tool, one more hire, upgraded office. Individually reasonable. Collectively
      lethal. Nobody owns total burn, so nobody stops it.
    solution: |
      # Weekly burn review:
      - Track every dollar
      - Compare to budget
      - Flag any increase

      # Zero-based budgeting:
      Every month, justify every expense
      "If we were starting from zero, would we spend this?"

      # The "fuck yes" test for every expense:
      If it's not "FUCK YES this is essential,"
      it's a no.

      # Kill the zombies:
      - Unused SaaS tools
      - Contractors not producing
      - Office perks nobody uses
      - '"We might need this someday" costs'
    symptoms:
      - Can't explain burn increase
      - Haven't looked at detailed expenses in months
      - Many small tools/subscriptions
      - '"We''ll cancel that eventually"'

  - id: premature-scaling-hire
    summary: Hiring ahead of revenue/traction to "be ready for growth"
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Raised Series A. "Need to build the team to hit targets." Hired 20 people.
      Growth didn't materialize. Now burning $500K/month with 12 months runway.
      Can't cut without looking like failure.
    why: |
      Hiring is the biggest burn lever. Each hire is a long-term commitment (hard
      to undo). Founders hire for the future they hope for, not the present they
      have. "We'll grow into it" is how companies die.
    solution: |
      # Hiring rule:
      Hire when you're drowning in work you can't do
      Not when you anticipate future need

      # The pain test:
      "Are we actively losing customers/revenue due to lack of this role?"
      If no, don't hire.

      # Hire slow, fire fast:
      - Wait until absolutely necessary
      - Contract first when possible
      - Every hire must 10x their cost

      # Founders do more:
      Early stage, founders should do jobs
      that later will need dedicated people.
      This builds context and delays burn.
    symptoms:
      - Hiring for "when we grow"
      - Big team but small revenue
      - Managers managing 2 people
      - '"We need to staff up"'

  - id: bridge-desperation
    summary: Taking a bridge round from position of weakness
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Running low on cash. Can't raise a proper round. Existing investors offer
      bridge with harsh terms. Take it because no choice. Now have worse cap
      table and same problems.
    why: |
      Bridge rounds from weakness compound problems. The terms are usually terrible
      (high interest, heavy liquidation preferences, control provisions). You get
      cash but lose leverage. And you still have to fix the underlying problem.
    solution: |
      # Bridge decision framework:
      Only take bridge if:
      - Clear path to milestone that unlocks real round
      - Terms are reasonable (not predatory)
      - 6+ months runway after bridge
      - Underlying business is fixable

      # Better alternatives:
      - Cut to profitability (own your destiny)
      - Revenue sprint (solve with customers)
      - Acqui-hire (graceful exit)
      - Wind down (better than zombie)

      # If you must bridge:
      - Negotiate hard (they need you to succeed)
      - Set clear milestone
      - Don't assume next round is guaranteed
    symptoms:
      - '"We just need to get through this"'
      - Bridge terms not carefully reviewed
      - No clear plan for after bridge
      - Hope-based projections

  - id: cost-cut-too-little
    summary: Making small cuts instead of one decisive reduction
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Need to cut burn. Fire 2 people. Still burning too much. Fire 2 more.
      Still not enough. Now on third round of cuts. Team morale destroyed,
      best people leaving, still not at sustainable burn.
    why: |
      Death by a thousand cuts - for the company and morale. Each small layoff
      creates anxiety. Best people leave before they're cut. By the third round,
      trust is gone. Better to cut once, cut deep, and rebuild.
    solution: |
      # The one-cut rule:
      If you need to cut, cut to 18+ months runway
      Assume things get worse before better
      Add 20% buffer to your estimate

      # How to cut:
      - Do it all at once
      - Be generous with severance
      - Be transparent about why
      - Immediately refocus on path forward

      # After cutting:
      - Communicate stability to remaining team
      - No more cuts for at least 6 months
      - Focus energy on growth, not cost
    symptoms:
      - '"We''ll cut a little and see"'
      - Multiple rounds of cuts in 6 months
      - Always cutting "one or two people"
      - Team constantly anxious about cuts

  - id: revenue-as-afterthought
    summary: Treating revenue as something that will happen eventually
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Focus on growth, users, product. Revenue is "next quarter." Burn rate
      assumes future revenue that never materializes. "We'll monetize when
      we have scale."
    why: |
      Revenue is the only real validation. Users who pay are different from
      users who don't. Every month without revenue is a month closer to death.
      The best companies are revenue-focused from day one.
    solution: |
      # Day one mentality:
      - Charge something from the start
      - Even $10/month validates
      - Free users are not customers

      # Revenue goals:
      - Weekly revenue target
      - Track like you track users
      - Celebrate revenue milestones

      # Ramen profitability:
      - Can the founders live on the revenue?
      - This is the first milestone
      - Everything else is theoretical until this

      # Revenue solves problems:
      - Extends runway
      - Proves market
      - Reduces fundraising pressure
    symptoms:
      - '"We''ll monetize later"'
      - No revenue in first year
      - Revenue not in weekly metrics
      - Discussing DAU but not MRR

  - id: vanity-office-trap
    summary: Spending on office/perks that don't drive growth
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Raised Series A. Got a nice office. Catered lunches. Fancy equipment.
      "We need this to attract talent." Actually burning $30K/month on
      perks that don't matter. That's 6+ months runway gone in a year.
    why: |
      Office and perks feel like success but don't create it. Early-stage
      companies win with speed and focus, not amenities. Money spent on
      ping pong tables is money not spent on product and customers.
    solution: |
      # Early-stage office rules:
      - Cheapest acceptable space
      - No catered lunch
      - Standard equipment
      - WeWork/flexible beats lease

      # Where to spend:
      - Product development
      - Customer acquisition
      - Key hires (comp, not perks)

      # The signal problem:
      Nice office signals success you haven't earned
      Scrappy office keeps everyone hungry

      # Perks that matter:
      - Health insurance (essential)
      - Equity (alignment)
      - Flexibility (trust)
      Not: snacks, games, fancy chairs
    symptoms:
      - Office cost > 10% of burn
      - Perks before profitability
      - '"We need this to recruit"'
      - Visitors comment on nice office

  - id: consultant-contractor-leak
    summary: Spending on consultants/contractors without tracking ROI
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Multiple consultants "helping" with various things. PR firm, design
      agency, strategy consultant, recruiting firm. Each individually approved.
      Together, $50K/month with unclear value.
    why: |
      Consultants and contractors are easy to add, hard to evaluate, and
      invisible in headcount. They don't show up in "team size" but show up
      in burn. Often they're doing work founders should do themselves early on.
    solution: |
      # Contractor audit:
      - List all contractors/consultants
      - What specific value do they provide?
      - What would happen if we cut them?

      # Rules for contractors:
      - Time-bound engagements only
      - Clear deliverables
      - Monthly ROI review
      - Default to cutting unless obvious value

      # What founders should do themselves:
      - Early PR (your story, your voice)
      - Recruiting (you're selling the company)
      - Strategy (that's your job)

      # When contractors make sense:
      - Specific expertise for specific project
      - Temporary capacity (not ongoing)
      - Clear end date
    symptoms:
      - '"Various consultants" on budget'
      - Can't name what each one does
      - Contractors on retainer for months
      - Contractor spend not in regular review

  - id: inventory-cash-trap
    summary: Tying up cash in inventory or prepaid expenses
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Got a discount for annual payment. Bought 6 months of inventory.
      Prepaid for conference booth. Now 30% of cash is tied up in things
      you can't spend on growth.
    why: |
      Cash tied up is cash unavailable. That annual prepay might "save" 20%
      but costs you 100% of optionality. In a startup, optionality is survival.
      Pay monthly, stay flexible.
    solution: |
      # Cash preservation rules:
      - Pay monthly when possible
      - No annual contracts early stage
      - Minimal inventory
      - No prepay unless critical

      # The optionality value:
      That 20% discount costs optionality
      What if you need to pivot?
      What if you need to cut?

      # Inventory management:
      - Just-in-time when possible
      - 2 weeks buffer max
      - Cash in bank beats widgets in warehouse

      # Exceptions:
      - True essentials (AWS, core tools)
      - Where discount is >40%
      - When you have 24+ months runway
    symptoms:
      - Significant annual prepays
      - Large inventory balance
      - Conference booths paid months ahead
      - '"We got a good deal"'
