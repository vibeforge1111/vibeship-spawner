# Founder Mode Sharp Edges
# The traps that turn founders into figureheads - and how to avoid them

sharp_edges:
  - id: premature-delegation
    summary: Delegating before you understand the work deeply enough
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Series A. Hired VP of Engineering. "They're the expert, I'll let them handle
      it." 6 months later, technical debt is crushing, wrong architecture, team is
      demoralized. Founder doesn't understand what went wrong because they stepped
      back too early.
    why: |
      You can't delegate what you don't understand. VPs bring expertise but not your
      context. Without founder involvement, drift happens slowly then suddenly.
      The best founders stay dangerously close to the work until they could do it
      themselves if needed.
    solution: |
      # Before delegating any function:
      - Work in that role yourself for 2-4 weeks minimum
      - Know the key decisions and tradeoffs
      - Understand what "good" looks like

      # When you do delegate:
      - Stay connected through skip-levels
      - Review actual work, not just reports
      - Keep enough context to smell problems

      # The test:
      "Could I step back in and do this for a month if I had to?"
      If no, you delegated too early
    symptoms:
      - "That's not my area anymore"
      - Learning about problems from all-hands, not in real-time
      - Can't explain what your team is building
      - Surprised by quality/timeline issues

  - id: manager-mode-drift
    summary: Unconsciously shifting from founder mode to manager mode
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Calendar full of 1:1s, staff meetings, reviews. Zero time building or
      talking to customers. "I'm managing the company now." Company loses
      velocity, innovation stops, best people leave.
    why: |
      Every meeting, every process, every "professionalization" step pulls you
      away from the work. It happens gradually. One day you realize you're a
      facilitator, not a founder. The company becomes a machine that optimizes
      for its own continuation.
    solution: |
      # Protect maker time:
      - 50%+ of calendar for deep work
      - Batch meetings into 2-3 days
      - Guard mornings ruthlessly

      # Stay in the arena:
      - Talk to customers weekly (yourself, not reports)
      - Review code/design/copy regularly
      - Make at least one key product decision weekly

      # The "factory test":
      Are you running the factory or building new things?
      Founders build. Managers run.
    symptoms:
      - Haven't talked to a customer in 2+ weeks
      - Haven't reviewed code/design in a month
      - Calendar is 100% meetings
      - "I trust the team to handle product"

  - id: vc-professionalization-pressure
    summary: Letting VCs push you into "professional CEO" mode too early
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Board meeting. VC says "You need to step back and hire executives."
      "You're the bottleneck." "A real CEO delegates." You hire a layer of
      management. Company loses its soul.
    why: |
      VCs have seen professional CEOs work at scale. They pattern-match. But
      what works at 1000 people doesn't work at 50. And the founder's judgment,
      context, and intensity can't be replaced by process. Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,
      Brian Chesky - they all ignore this advice.
    solution: |
      # Understand VCs' frame:
      - They manage portfolios, not companies
      - They optimize for predictability
      - Their "pattern" is the median, not the outlier

      # The founder advantage:
      - You have context no hire will have
      - Your conviction creates reality
      - Speed of founder decisions beats process

      # When to push back:
      "I understand the pattern, but this company needs founder intensity.
      I'll hire support, but I'm staying close to the work."

      # Find founder-friendly VCs:
      Who have backed founder-mode companies successfully
    symptoms:
      - "The board says I need to step back"
      - Hiring executives to appease investors
      - Adding process to look "mature"
      - Doubting your own judgment

  - id: skip-level-fear
    summary: Not talking directly to ICs because it might "undermine managers"
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Want to understand what engineering is working on. HR says "go through your
      VP, skip-levels undermine management." You lose direct insight into the work.
      Problems get filtered before reaching you.
    why: |
      Management layers filter information. Bad news gets softened. Problems get
      hidden. By the time you hear about something, it's often too late. Skip-levels
      aren't undermining - they're staying connected.
    solution: |
      # Normalize skip-levels:
      - Regular skip-level 1:1s (monthly minimum)
      - Announced and transparent
      - Not about manager feedback, about work and context

      # What to ask:
      - "What are you working on?"
      - "What's slowing you down?"
      - "What would you change?"
      - "Is there anything you wish leadership knew?"

      # Make it safe:
      - Never relay specific feedback to managers
      - Look for patterns, not individuals
      - Follow up on systemic issues

      # Frame for managers:
      "I do skip-levels to stay connected to the work, not to evaluate you"
    symptoms:
      - Haven't talked to an IC in weeks
      - Only hear about problems in retrospectives
      - Don't know what teams are actually building
      - Information feels filtered

  - id: context-loss-scaling
    summary: Losing context as company scales, making worse decisions
    severity: high
    situation: |
      100 people now. Can't know everything. Making decisions based on incomplete
      info. Worse decisions than when you were 10 people. "I need to trust my team."
    why: |
      Scaling means losing context by default. But context is your competitive
      advantage. The founders who scale well find ways to maintain context even
      as they can't be everywhere. They're intentional about what they stay close to.
    solution: |
      # Pick 2-3 areas to stay deep:
      - Product (always)
      - One other based on current challenges
      - Rotate based on strategic priority

      # Context systems:
      - Weekly metrics review (you, not a report)
      - Customer calls (at least 2/week)
      - Commit log scanning (15 min daily)
      - Skip-level 1:1s

      # Accept partial context elsewhere:
      - Hire great people for other areas
      - Check in monthly, not weekly
      - Trust but verify through outcomes
    symptoms:
      - Making decisions with stale info
      - Surprised by quarterly results
      - Don't know key customer stories
      - Rely on reports, not direct observation

  - id: hiring-to-escape
    summary: Hiring people to avoid doing work you don't want to do
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Don't like sales? Hire a VP of Sales and hand it off. Don't like ops?
      Hire a COO. Company ends up with expensive leaders and a founder who
      doesn't understand critical functions.
    why: |
      Founders often hire to escape parts of the job they dislike. But those parts
      are often critical. Sales teaches you customer needs. Ops teaches you how
      the company works. You can't lead what you don't understand.
    solution: |
      # Before hiring to escape:
      - Do the job yourself for 2-4 weeks
      - Understand what success looks like
      - Know enough to evaluate the hire

      # The "escape hire" test:
      "Am I hiring because this is important or because I want to avoid it?"
      If avoid, do it yourself first.

      # After hiring:
      - Stay involved for the first 3-6 months
      - Joint calls/meetings initially
      - Ensure context transfer, not just handoff
    symptoms:
      - "I hate X, let's hire someone"
      - Hired for function you don't understand
      - "They're the expert, I'll let them handle it"
      - Can't evaluate if they're doing a good job

  - id: founder-burnout-spiral
    summary: Running so hard in founder mode that you burn out
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Working 100-hour weeks. No breaks. Answering Slack at 2am. "I have to
      be everywhere." Eventually crash. Company suffers while you recover.
    why: |
      Founder mode isn't about hours. It's about context and decisions. Working
      unsustainably doesn't help - it hurts. Burned-out founders make bad decisions.
      The goal is intensity over time, not maximum intensity until collapse.
    solution: |
      # Sustainable founder mode:
      - Deep work blocks, not constant firefighting
      - Protected recovery time
      - Delegation of execution, not understanding

      # Intensity rhythm:
      - Sprints for launches, fundraising, crises
      - Recovery between sprints
      - Baseline sustainable pace

      # What to protect:
      - Sleep (7+ hours, non-negotiable)
      - One day off per week (minimum)
      - Physical health
      - One relationship outside work

      # Signs you need to recover:
      - Decision quality degrading
      - Snapping at people
      - Can't focus for 2+ hours
      - Dread going to work
    symptoms:
      - "I'll rest after we [milestone]"
      - Can't remember last day off
      - Feeling resentful of the company
      - Quality of work declining

  - id: delegation-of-judgment
    summary: Delegating decisions that only the founder can make
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Big product decision. "Let the product team decide, I don't want to
      micromanage." Team makes safe choice. Miss the bold move that would have
      changed the company's trajectory.
    why: |
      Some decisions require founder judgment - the willingness to be wrong, the
      context across the whole company, the long-term vision. Employees optimize
      for not being blamed. Founders can optimize for being right.
    solution: |
      # Decisions to never delegate:
      - Core product direction
      - Key hires (final interview)
      - Major customer/partner deals
      - Company-defining bets

      # Decisions to always delegate:
      - Execution details
      - Most hiring
      - Day-to-day operations
      - Technical implementation

      # The "bet the company" test:
      If this decision could significantly change our trajectory,
      founder must be deeply involved.
    symptoms:
      - "I trust the team's judgment"
      - Finding out about major decisions after they're made
      - Team choosing safe/consensus options
      - Missing bold moves

  - id: process-over-judgment
    summary: Replacing founder judgment with process and frameworks
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Hired a consultant. Implemented OKRs, KPIs, 360 reviews, roadmap process.
      Everything is "process compliant" but nothing is great. Founder judgment
      replaced by committee decisions.
    why: |
      Process is necessary but insufficient. Process creates predictability at
      the cost of excellence. Great companies are built by judgment calls that
      no process would have produced. Process should support judgment, not replace it.
    solution: |
      # Process principles:
      - Minimum viable process
      - Serve the work, not the other way around
      - Kill processes that aren't working

      # Where process helps:
      - Communication at scale
      - Coordination between teams
      - Compliance/legal requirements

      # Where process kills:
      - Product decisions
      - Creative work
      - Speed-critical situations

      # The "process tax" test:
      For every process: "What would we lose if we killed this?"
      If the answer is unclear, kill it.
    symptoms:
      - More time in process than building
      - "We can't do that, it's not in the roadmap"
      - Meetings about meetings
      - Slow decision-making

  - id: title-inflation-trap
    summary: Giving VP titles too early, losing leverage for real executives
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      20-person company. Everyone is a VP. When you need to hire actual
      executives, titles are already used up. Current "VPs" can't be demoted.
    why: |
      Titles are currency. Spend them early and they're gone. Hiring a real VP
      of Engineering when you have 5 "Staff Engineers" who are actually
      senior developers creates chaos. Save titles for when you need them.
    solution: |
      # Title principles:
      - Under-title early (you can always promote)
      - Save VP titles for 50+ person company
      - Director titles rare before 30 people

      # Better alternatives:
      - "Lead" instead of "VP"
      - Scope increases without title changes
      - Compensation separate from title

      # When you do need real executives:
      - Can offer clean titles
      - No awkward demotions
      - Clear hierarchy
    symptoms:
      - 15-person company with 4 VPs
      - Can't hire a real executive because title is taken
      - Title inflation every 6 months
      - People optimizing for titles, not impact
