# YC Playbook Sharp Edges
# The mistakes that kill YC companies - learned from thousands of startups

sharp_edges:
  - id: building-before-talking
    summary: Building features before talking to users
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      3 weeks into YC batch. Heads down coding. Haven't talked to a single
      user this week. "We'll get feedback after we ship this feature."
    why: |
      Every week in YC is precious. Building in isolation means building the wrong
      thing. By the time you ship, you've lost 3 weeks that could have been
      learning. YC companies that talk to users weekly grow 5x faster.
    solution: |
      # Weekly user contact minimum:
      - 10+ user conversations per week (not surveys, conversations)
      - Schedule them on Monday, protect that time

      # The YC user interview cadence:
      Monday: Schedule 10-15 calls for the week
      Tue-Thu: Talk to users
      Friday: Ship based on learnings

      # What to ask:
      - "What's the hardest part about [problem]?"
      - "Tell me about the last time you..."
      - "How are you solving this today?"
      - Never: "Would you use this feature?"
    symptoms:
      - "We'll talk to users after we ship"
      - "Users don't know what they want"
      - "We're building what we know they need"
      - Zero user calls on calendar this week

  - id: demo-day-distraction
    summary: Optimizing for demo day instead of building a real business
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      6 weeks before demo day. All focus shifts to pitch, deck, and vanity
      metrics that look good on stage. Product development slows. User
      conversations stop. "We need to focus on fundraising."
    why: |
      Demo day is 2 minutes. Your company is (hopefully) 10+ years. Founders who
      optimize for demo day often raise money but fail afterwards because they
      stopped building. The best demo day pitches come from real traction.
    solution: |
      # Demo day is a side effect, not the goal:
      Keep building and talking to users through demo day prep

      # The 80/20 rule:
      80% time on product/users
      20% time on pitch prep

      # Best pitch = real traction:
      "We have X users doing Y" beats any polished narrative

      # After demo day matters more:
      The companies that keep building during fundraising
      are the ones worth funding
    symptoms:
      - "We need to pause product for demo day prep"
      - Hours spent on pitch animations
      - No user calls in last 2 weeks
      - "Let's make our metrics look better"
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: vanity-metrics-theater
    summary: Reporting metrics that look good but don't matter
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Investor update: "10,000 signups! 50,000 page views! Featured in
      TechCrunch!" Reality: 50 active users, $500 MRR, 90% churn.
    why: |
      Vanity metrics feel good but hide the truth. Investors see through them.
      Partners definitely see through them. You're only fooling yourself, and
      that's the most dangerous person to fool.
    solution: |
      # The only metrics that matter for YC:
      - Revenue (or strong proxy)
      - Active users (weekly, not monthly)
      - Retention/churn
      - Growth rate (week over week)

      # Format for investor updates:
      Revenue: $X (+Y% WoW)
      Active Users: X (+Y% WoW)
      Key Insight: [one learning from users]
      Biggest Challenge: [be honest]
      Ask: [specific help needed]

      # The "revenue or engagement" test:
      If it doesn't drive revenue or engagement,
      it's a vanity metric
    symptoms:
      - Leading with press mentions
      - '"Downloads" instead of "active users"'
      - '"Signups" instead of "retention"'
      - No revenue number in update

  - id: office-hours-theater
    summary: Telling partners what they want to hear instead of truth
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Office hours. Partner asks hard questions. Founder spins positive.
      "Users love it!" (3 users). "Growth is strong!" (friends signing up).
      Partner can't help because they don't know real situation.
    why: |
      Partners have seen 4000+ companies. They can help with any problem. But
      they can only help if they know the truth. Spin wastes everyone's time
      and deprives you of the best advice available.
    solution: |
      # Come with real problems:
      "We're struggling with X, we've tried Y and Z"

      # Be specific:
      Not: "Users are confused"
      Yes: "3 of 5 users couldn't complete checkout, here's where they dropped"

      # Partners want to help:
      They've seen every problem, probably have solutions
      But only if you're honest

      # The vulnerability advantage:
      Founders who are honest about struggles
      get better advice and more partner support
    symptoms:
      - Only sharing good news
      - Vague answers to hard questions
      - "We're figuring it out"
      - Not asking for specific help

  - id: pivot-without-conviction
    summary: Pivoting because things are hard, not because you learned something
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Week 4. Initial idea is hard. User acquisition is slow. "Maybe we should
      pivot to B2B." Week 6. B2B is hard. "Maybe we should try a different
      vertical." Endless pivoting, never committing.
    why: |
      Every good idea feels impossible at first. Pivoting is sometimes right,
      but pivoting because things are hard is always wrong. The best companies
      look like bad ideas initially.
    solution: |
      # Pivot criteria (must have 2+ to pivot):
      - Talked to 50+ users about this problem
      - Clear pattern: people don't have this problem
      - Found a better problem during research
      - Been at it for 3+ months with no signal

      # Don't pivot because:
      - Growth is slow (it always is at first)
      - It's hard (it always is)
      - Someone said it won't work (they always do)

      # Commit fully:
      Pick a direction and go hard for 6-8 weeks
      Then evaluate with real data, not feelings
    symptoms:
      - New idea every office hours
      - "We're exploring options"
      - Less than 3 weeks on current idea
      - Pivoting without user research
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: launch-procrastination
    summary: Waiting until it's "ready" to launch
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Week 6. "We'll launch next week when we add this feature."
      Week 8. "Almost ready, just need to fix these bugs."
      Week 10. Still haven't launched. Demo day in 2 weeks.
    why: |
      Launching is scary because it's the moment of truth. But every day you don't
      launch is a day you're not learning from real users. The market doesn't care
      about your feelings. Launch.
    solution: |
      # The YC launch rule:
      If you're not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late

      # Launch checklist (that's it):
      - Core value prop works (barely)
      - Users can sign up
      - You can contact users who sign up

      # What doesn't matter for launch:
      - Perfect UI
      - All features
      - Scalability
      - Edge cases

      # Do it now:
      Pick a date this week
      Tell someone so you're accountable
      Ship
    symptoms:
      - "Just one more feature"
      - "We need to polish the UI"
      - "What if it breaks?"
      - In batch 4+ weeks without launching

  - id: yc-network-ignorance
    summary: Not leveraging the YC network and alumni
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Struggling with a problem. Don't know any other YC founders. Haven't
      posted in Bookface. Haven't reached out to alumni in your space.
      Trying to figure everything out alone.
    why: |
      The YC network is worth more than the money. Alumni have solved your
      exact problem. Batch-mates are going through the same struggles. Not
      using the network is leaving millions of dollars of value on the table.
    solution: |
      # Week 1 actions:
      - Post intro in Bookface
      - Find 10 alumni in your space, message them
      - Find 5 batch-mates with similar challenges

      # When stuck:
      - Post in Bookface asking for help
      - Message 3-5 alumni who've solved this
      - Ask partners for intro to relevant founders

      # Pay it forward:
      - Help other founders when you can
      - The network compounds over time
    symptoms:
      - "I don't want to bother anyone"
      - Never posted in Bookface
      - Don't know batch-mates
      - Solving everything alone

  - id: cofounder-conflict-denial
    summary: Ignoring cofounder tensions until they explode
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Growing tension with cofounder. Different visions. Unequal workload.
      Communication breaking down. "We'll work it out." Blow up at demo day.
    why: |
      Cofounder breakups are the #1 killer of early-stage startups. They rarely
      happen suddenly - there are always warning signs. Ignoring them doesn't
      make them go away.
    solution: |
      # Weekly cofounder check-in:
      - What's working?
      - What's not working?
      - Any resentments building?

      # When things feel off:
      - Talk about it immediately, not later
      - Consider bringing in partner as mediator
      - Better to address early than let it fester

      # Hard conversations:
      - Role clarity: who owns what?
      - Equity: is it still fair?
      - Vision: are we aligned on the goal?

      # If it's not working:
      Better to split early than blow up later
    symptoms:
      - Avoiding conversations
      - "We'll figure it out later"
      - Different stories to partners
      - Not talking outside of work stuff

  - id: post-batch-cliff
    summary: Losing momentum after YC ends
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Demo day done. Raised a round. Batch ends. Suddenly no structure.
      No weekly office hours. No batch-mates pushing you. Momentum dies.
    why: |
      YC provides external accountability and pressure. When it ends, founders
      often unconsciously relax. The companies that win are the ones that
      maintain YC intensity indefinitely.
    solution: |
      # Keep the cadence:
      - Weekly metrics tracking (don't stop)
      - Monthly investor updates
      - Regular user conversations

      # Create accountability:
      - Mastermind group with batch-mates
      - Monthly check-ins with partner
      - Public goals and commitments

      # Maintain intensity:
      - YC was the warm-up
      - The real work starts now
      - Keep the urgency
    symptoms:
      - "We'll take a break after fundraising"
      - Stopped tracking weekly metrics
      - No investor updates in 2+ months
      - Lost touch with batch-mates
    detection_pattern: null

  - id: investor-update-neglect
    summary: Not sending regular investor updates
    severity: medium
    situation: |
      Raised money. Got busy building. Haven't updated investors in 3 months.
      When you need help or more money, no one knows what you're doing.
    why: |
      Investor updates aren't just obligation - they're leverage. Regular updates
      keep you top of mind for intros, follow-on, and help. Dark founders get
      forgotten and miss opportunities.
    solution: |
      # Monthly update template:

  - id: feature-request-following
    summary: Building what users ask for instead of what they need
    severity: high
    situation: |
      Users asking for features. Building all of them. Product becomes Frankenstein.
      Core value prop diluted. "But users asked for it!"
    why: |
      Users are experts on their problems, not solutions. When they ask for features,
      they're usually describing symptoms, not root causes. Building requests creates
      bloat. Understanding problems creates breakthroughs.
    solution: |
      # When user requests a feature:
      "What are you trying to accomplish?"
      "Why is that important?"
      "How are you doing this today?"

      # The 5 Whys:
      Keep asking why until you find root cause
      Then solve that, not the surface request

      # Say no by default:
      Unless 5+ users have same underlying problem
      And it aligns with core value prop
      Don't build it

      # Jobs to be Done:
      What job is user hiring your product to do?
      Features that don't serve that job dilute the product
    symptoms:
      - Building every requested feature
      - Roadmap is user request list
      - Product scope keeps expanding
      - Lost sight of core value prop

  - id: tarpit-idea-trap
    summary: Pursuing an idea that sounds good but has structural problems
    severity: critical
    situation: |
      Consumer social app. Hardware for X. Marketplace for Y. Idea sounds great
      in pitch but has fundamental challenges that make success nearly impossible.
    why: |
      Some ideas are tarpits - they attract founders but have structural problems
      that make them nearly impossible. Consumer social needs viral growth. Hardware
      needs capital and manufacturing. Marketplaces need both sides simultaneously.
    solution: |
      # Common tarpits to avoid (or approach with eyes open):
      - Consumer social without viral mechanic
      - Hardware without $10M+ for manufacturing
      - Two-sided marketplace without chicken-egg solution
      - Regulated industries without domain expertise
      - Enterprise sales without connections

      # Questions to ask:
      - Why hasn't this been solved?
      - What's my unfair advantage?
      - What do I know that others don't?

      # If you're in a tarpit:
      - Find the niche within the niche
      - Or get out early before you sink
    symptoms:
      - "It's a social network for X"
      - "We're building hardware"
      - "It's a marketplace"
      - No clear unfair advantage
