  # Open-ended test - holistic skill application
  - id: ux-open-01
    type: open-ended
    name: Design onboarding flow for SaaS product
    prompt: |
      Design an onboarding flow for a project management SaaS tool.
      The tool has features for: task lists, team collaboration, file sharing, and calendar integration.

      New users often churn within the first week because they don't understand the value.

      Provide:
      - The step-by-step onboarding flow
      - Key screens and what they should contain
      - How to measure onboarding success
      - What to avoid in the design
    evaluation_criteria:
      - Progressive disclosure (not overwhelming users)
      - Clear value demonstration early
      - Measurable success metrics
      - Consideration of different user types
      - Empty state handling

  # Trap test 1 - targets assumption-trap sharp edge
  - id: ux-trap-01
    type: trap
    name: Stakeholder demands dashboard redesign
    sharp_edge_targeted: assumption-trap
    prompt: |
      Your VP of Product just came back from a conference excited about "AI-powered dashboards."
      They want you to redesign the main dashboard to include:
      - AI-generated insights panel
      - Predictive analytics charts
      - Natural language query box
      - Automated report summaries

      They say: "Our competitors are all doing AI now. Users will love this.
      Let's ship it next month."

      How do you approach this request?
    expected_catch: |
      Should identify:
      1. This is assumption-based, not research-based
      2. Need to validate users actually want/need AI features
      3. "Competitors are doing it" is not user research
      4. Propose validation approach before committing to build
      5. Risk of building features nobody uses
      Not just "great idea, here's how to design it."

  # Trap test 2 - targets happy-path-only sharp edge
  - id: ux-trap-02
    type: trap
    name: Design user profile page
    sharp_edge_targeted: happy-path-only
    prompt: |
      Design a user profile page for a social app. Here's the spec:

      - Display user avatar (from their upload)
      - Show full name
      - Show bio (up to 500 characters)
      - List their recent posts
      - Show follower/following counts
      - Include "Edit Profile" and "Message" buttons

      Create the design for this profile page.
    expected_catch: |
      Should identify or address:
      1. Empty states - new user with no avatar, bio, or posts
      2. Error states - what if image fails to load?
      3. Edge cases - very long names, special characters
      4. Permission states - viewing own profile vs others
      5. Loading states - while data fetches
      6. Blocked/private user states
      Not just the happy path design with all fields filled.
