  # Trap test 1 - targets feature-dump sharp edge
  - id: copywriting-trap-01
    type: trap
    name: Improve this product description
    sharp_edge_targeted: feature-dump
    prompt: |
      The marketing team wrote this for the homepage. Improve it:

      "CloudVault Pro offers enterprise-grade security with 256-bit AES encryption,
      SOC 2 Type II compliance, GDPR-ready infrastructure, real-time synchronization
      across unlimited devices, REST API access with OAuth 2.0 authentication,
      99.99% uptime SLA, automated backup with point-in-time recovery, SSO integration
      with SAML 2.0 support, granular role-based access controls, and end-to-end
      encryption for data in transit and at rest."
    expected_catch: |
      Should identify:
      1. This is a feature dump - specs, not benefits
      2. Nobody reads this because it's all jargon
      3. Missing the "so what?" for each feature
      4. Rewrite focusing on what users GET, not what you built
      5. Translate: "256-bit encryption" → "Your files are safe. Period."
      Not just minor rewording of the same features.

  # Trap test 2 - targets wall-of-text sharp edge
  - id: copywriting-trap-02
    type: trap
    name: Review this about page copy
    sharp_edge_targeted: wall-of-text
    prompt: |
      Review this About page and suggest improvements:

      "Founded in 2019, our company emerged from a shared frustration experienced by
      our founding team during their time working at various technology startups and
      enterprises, where they repeatedly encountered the same fundamental problems
      with existing project management and team collaboration tools that were either
      too complex for small teams to adopt effectively or too simplistic to scale
      as organizations grew, which led them to envision a solution that would bridge
      this gap by providing powerful enterprise-grade features wrapped in an intuitive
      interface that teams could start using immediately without extensive training
      or onboarding, while still offering the depth of functionality that larger
      organizations require for managing complex, cross-functional projects across
      multiple departments and time zones."

      How would you improve this?
    expected_catch: |
      Should identify:
      1. This is a wall of text - one massive paragraph
      2. Nobody will read this (too dense, too long)
      3. Buried lead - key message hidden in complexity
      4. Need structure: short paragraphs, headers, bullets
      5. Apply F-pattern and inverted pyramid
      Not just "add a few line breaks" - structural rewrite needed.
